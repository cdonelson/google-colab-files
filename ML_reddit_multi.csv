"High School Senior (from The Wellspring) by Sharon Olds 
 For seventeen years, her breath in the house
 at night, puff, puff, like summer
   cumulus above her bed,
  and her scalp smelling of apricots
     --this being who had formed within me,
    squatted like a bright tree-frog in the dark,
    like an eohippus she had come out of history
  slowly, through me, into the daylight,
 I had the daily sight of her,
  like food or air she was there, like a mother.
   I say ‚Äúcollege,‚Äù but I feel as if I cannot tell
   the difference between her leaving for college
  and our parting forever‚ÄîI try to see
  this house without her, without her pure
   depth of feeling, without her creek-brown
 hair, her daedal hands with their tapered
    fingers, her pupils dark as the mourning cloak‚Äôs
 wing, but I can‚Äôt. Seventeen years
   ago, in the this room, she moved inside me,
  I looked at the river, I could not imagine
    my life with her. I gazed across the street,
    and saw, in the icy winter sin,
   a column of steam rush up away from the earth.
 There are creatures whose children float away
  at birth, and those who throat-feed their young
     for weeks and never see them again. My daughter
   is free and she is in me‚Äîno, my love
   of her is in me, moving in my heart,
  changing chambers, like something poured
   from hand to hand, to be weighed and then reweighed.",6
"My parents are happily married for almost 30 years this April. None of my close family has ever been through a divorce let alone with a child involved. A bit of history if that helps. I[F27] got married to my ex, lets call him J[M37] in 2007. We dated for a year. I as so young[20] and thought I knew what love was. I more or less understand now that all I wanted was to get out of my parent's house and have my own freedoms. I was very sheltered and they were kind of controlling, but I think its the only way they knew to show they cared. So, we get married a year from the day we met. We hadn't lived together(that was a big faux pas) and all I knew about him was that he would give me anything I wanted and treated me really well. 
So we move into a small apartment. I quit 4 year college to follow other pursuits and had a bit of trouble finding a job, but it wasn't a big deal because he made good money and our bills were pretty much nonexistent. He worked third shift and I cooked and kept the house clean. He didn't have to do much and was pretty content with that. Well I ended up getting pregnant about 6 months after we got married. I was nervous, but being a 21 year old, didn't quite understand what it meant to have a child. I was content with playing house and thought this was all part of it.
 I get a job in insurance and am thinking about getting certified. Its easy and I'm good with people, but it doesn't make me happy. Well, my mom decides that our two bedroom apartment is no place to raise a baby and convinces me that I need to buy a house. J seems on board and we find a great little place out in the country a bit. 2.75 acres and 3 bedrooms, a two car garage and a big kitchen. Its in foreclosure so we get it for $70,000 under value and are so excited. 
 Move in, have the baby and it all goes to shit. J didn't have a dad. Mom had to work three jobs to raise him and his sister. They grew up poor and the first time he went to the dentist was after we were married. His mom has gained weight and gotten disability and constantly tries to move in with us. Sister and family attack me saying I am a terrible person because I won't care for a woman who is known for mooching off of her kids. Sister gets married has 4 kids and gets them taken away for producing meth in the shed behind the house. Just to give you a snapshot of the type of family I have to deal with. 
 I am pretty sure, looking back, that I had postpartum depression. I loved my son immensely, but I resented him for getting all the attention I had had for the past 22 years. I couldn't feed him and felt like a failure as a mother. I slept all day, quit two jobs in the same year. I didn't shower or cook or clean or eat properly. I gained 50+ pounds and emotionally neglected my son. I look back on this now and I hate myself for it. I let my parents(who only wanted to spend time with their only grandchild)step in and basically raise my son when I was too tired. They had him every weekend and some week nights. I couldn't be bothered to care for him, but I could go out and do all the things I loved before I got pregnant. 
 J never helped cook or clean or watch after our boy. He reasoned that since I wasn't working and just stayed home all day that I should be able to take care of everything and he shouldn't have to. He never noticed that something was wrong with me. That I wasn't myself. I used to take such pride in my appearance and my home, but I just stopped caring. I suppose that should have been the first sign that something was wrong. As long as everything seemed fine on the surface, it was. There was no use in trying to look deeper into things. There isn't a 'deeper'. I started cooking again, but only as a distraction. I was baking and I loved it. 
 I took a job as a pastry chef at a local restaurant(nothing fancy)and the owner approached me about opening my own bakery. No one was going to tell me I didn't know how to run a business. Well, that failed, but I wanted to cook now more than ever. I took a job at the local college(the one I dropped out of)and baked for them. I learned a lot about cooking from their banquet chef and decided I wanted to go to culinary school. The only problem was that it was two hours away. 
 Well, J's best friend lived in that town and said I could stay with him while I got my education. School was Mon-Thu and I went home every weekend. While I was away, my parent's had little man more than I would have liked. I would get mad at J, but I was getting to experience the freedom I never had. I eventually had to get a job because of the travel and my expenses and I was staying at school more and more. And my parents were keeping my son more and more. J never called me or texted me or said he missed me. And with me only being home two or three days a week, our problems became more magnified. I realized that he was selfish. That my core feelings of depression and failure didn't matter as long as he wasn't bothered with them. We fought more than ever and he was mostly mad that I was spending his money. Money was always important to him. 
 One weekend, I looked him in the eye and told him I wasn't happy. That I needed him to work with me. He needed to be less selfish. The house had fallen into disarray. I would fix his lunch for the week while I was at home on the weekends and all I got when I walked in the door was What do you want for dinner?"". No hug
  He said he was who he was and counseling wouldn't change him. He was set in his ways and I knew that when I married him. I was the one who was changing. Damn right I was. I was realizing that I had been a terribly impetuous child and an awful mother. But I was already $20K in debt and had finally found my passion. I couldn't quit school now. So I asked for a separation. He kind of joked about it and said that I could have whatever I wanted but he got the flat screen and the new washer and dryer and the house. I started crying and begging him to help me. To work with me. He didn't seem to care or be phased by it at all. So  Back to school. Staying with my parents on the weekends and visiting my child. My parents too it harder than anyone. And my son was confused and upset. It killed me to have him crying into my chest asking why mommy and daddy can't be friends anymore. I wanted to die but I knew it was better than hearing us fight all the time. Better than seeing us resent each other and growing up in a loveless home. We filed and at the time  My parents care for my child 90% of the time. I come home on my three days off and spend it all with him. Since my job is more than 100miles from my son's home he can't move here with me without J's consent. And rather than fight with him  Since I have left my ex has let his mom  He doesn't play with him or spend quality time with him. He doesn't make my son brush his teeth or take a bath before bed. He works third shift so most nights my mom has him On the occasional week night that he stays over my son sleeps in the bed with his 8 year old cousin who stays up all night and keeps him awake so he is cranky at day care and gets in trouble for fighting and the only adult in the house in J's mom who is morbidly obese  I have tried getting mad and tried asking nicely and tried begging and tried bargaining. He just gets defensive and says that I can't tell him how to be a dad. He won't listen to me at all and says that I left him so I have no say in how he raises our son. If I argue with him he will keep our son from my parents out of spite. When they get him back after a few days  I want to sue for custody but I would need my parents financial help and their legal support(its a very small community and we are related to half the judicial system). They don't want a big public fuss and negative attention  Does anyone have any advice? I am so sorry about the wall of text but I had to get all this out. My story is long I know
**TL;DR My ex isn't taking care of my son properly when he does find time to take care of him and gets defensive/with holds time with my son when confronted. My parents(his primary care givers)are going to enroll him in a different school next year and I know it will cause problems with my ex. I am worried that he will try to take him away from my parents altogether.**",6
" and I just had to share with you other moms! I know it may not seem like a big deal to anyone else but to me  instead of doubting what it could do for him! Go Aiden!! <3""",6
" and really sick of throwing away perfectly good food. Any advice reddit? I'm really at the end of my rope...How do I get a 5 year old to eat what I put in front of her?""",2
 but I can't tell if he is just refusing to co-operate,6
" but it's never been consistent on what we do  since his tantrums seem to be mainly when we're out.  I've heard good things about 1-2-3 Magic and thought about buying that.  Do any of you mama's have any advice?! Thanks in advance.""",6
" Caleb will eat yogurt - just normal yoplait or a gogurt. He's never liked baby food. I'll give him bits of whatever I'm eating throughout the day.

What are some good food choices for us to change to? **PS:** I'm pregnant.""",2
" he's healthy and happy. QUIT FUCKING TELLING ME HOW TO BE A MOM.   Okay  rant over.""",6
 I know that seeing us fighting and the anger that i help from the breakup affected my son's behavior and mood. I'm working on making sure our life is as stable as possible to help them through it. They don't care that their dad is gone because they never really had much relationship with him anyway. My oldest son has a movement disorder which is caused by an underlying anxiety disorder. Their dad has an anxiety disorder which causes hair-pulling,6
 I make them eat some fruits/vegetables and try meat things to see if they like. If they eat some good food they can have some cookies/ect. I do not feed them fast food. Pizza is for when they are really good. They have to do some coloring/craft stuff at my house when they stay for a few days. They can stay up as late they want. 3yr old is often watching scooby doo at 1am. Fine by me what harm is there if its not a school night. I make them say please and thank you and be courteous to everyone - manners are very important to me.,1
" is there a way i can easily and cheaply sort out the area aroundhis high chair so i can safely give his food back to him? I cant afford to waste so much. Also has anyone else been through this? """,6
" it's a comfort thing. She doesn't even eat the full bottle when I give it to her. It just helps her get back to sleep. I should have worded that better. I check on her frequently I am not a bad mom and I would NEVER starve my child. Shame on all of you for jumping to conclusions.""",1
 just let her be a kid and have more independence  or that she's drinking tea at all! I'm hoping it was just Apple cider or something. Anyway  sorry for rambling! I'm just trying to pay close attention to my reactions/parenting right now and I need outside/unbiased input. Is this just another helicopter mom,6
" like when i ask ""where is your kitty? ""  it could be a thought/speech miscommunication.  Please give me some advice on this. I'm willing to try anything. Should I talk to her doctor about all this? Unfortunately  we only have access to Navy doctors so they tend to brush off things. Thank you for your advice! """,6
 my brother overheard my mom making a rude comment,6
" my choice"" issue?""
My response was : ""Ok I respect your decision but that does not mean I have to agree with it In order to back up her decision she repeatedly told me that her friends (some of which are pregnant) as well as her female family members stop breastfeeding and their husbands didn't say anything. The actual quote was ""their husbands wouldn't dare question them"". To which my response was ""...ok...well then I Feel bad for those men who don't feel like they can voice their opinion in their own relationship and for their child"".  She was taking it as an insult that I would possibly disagree with her decision to stop breastfeeding.
Now I know this might get backlash but I feel like to stop breast feeding is a cop out. It's the ""easy way out"".  There has been some other instances where I have had to say to her ""Listen  raising a baby is not supposed to be easy."" when she gets upset because the kid won't go to sleep instantly We have different mentalities when it comes to raising the baby. For me  its not about inconvenience.  Whatever my daughter needs Anyways  I OBVIOUSLY can't force her to breast feed the baby so she will make the final decision here. But I will not just say ""Ok that's fine with me"". I want the best of everything for my daughter.  Doctors and science (at least everything I have read) says that breastmilk is the optimal food for a baby. Not saying that formula is harmful in any way Am I just being overly controlling? Should I just blindly agree and backup my wife's decision without stating my opinion?
EDIT:  Just wanted to say thank you so much for all of the comments. I love hear everything from both sides of the coin on the issue. So many great perspectives brought up that I never thought of before. I am reading through all of the comments and plan to respond to every one. Thanks again. 
EDIT: Also just to clear a few matters up instead of repeating the same comments to questions posed: 
Night time feedings: I do get up and feed my daughter at night with the pumped milk store in the fridge.  My wife goes to bed around 9 or 10 with the baby I go to bed around midnight. Wife feeds her at one and puts the baby back in the room with me while she sleeps in the guest room or on the couch because she has trouble  getting back to sleep. When the baby wakes up again at 4-5am
EDIT : Here is a picture of my daughter and I http://i.imgur.com/NPWe6.jpg 
I would post one including my wife but I wouldn't want to do so without her permission
EDIT again: Talked to my wife today in the car on the way to a doctor appt. for my daughter.  Resolved a lot of what may have been misrepresented ideas last night. I explained exactly why I felt the way I did and she said she totally understood and probably could have worded the initial statement better.  I reassured her that I thought she was doing an amazing job as a mom as well as saying that while I do not agree with her decision to stop BFing",6
" no longer interested in the meal We relented and let her eat the candy and to be fair also let our 4 year old son have his.  Neither child was then able to finish their meal. Anybody have better ways to deal with unsolicited candy?""",6

" she was 3 days early (DAYS) and weighed 7lbs  no gestational diabetes  not even a lot of weight gain. I ate healthy. I was a bigger girl to begin with and when I have birth I was only up 14 pounds from my starting pregnancy weight. My daughter was given the highest APGAR rating and was deemed happy and healthy. I breastfed her exclusively the first six weeks and then she received 75% breast milk / 25% formula until she was about 3.5 months old. Since I work two jobs and I'm always gone  I dried up pretty quickly (sadly) and I didn't respond to the pump well. Moving along. My daughter has very very very slowly gained weight. I feel like she eats a lot though! My husband is her primary caretaker during the day and he tells me that she eats 8-10 4oz bottles of formula a day along with squishy baby foods which we have been introducing slowly for about 8 weeks now. Her doctor didn't seem concerned with her weight gain *at first* but now he seems to be. I certainly don't need CPS knocking on my door any time soon. I don't know what to do  ladies! Just today  I met a lovely couple with a baby boy who just hit 1 month of age. The mother saw my daughter  ""Oh wow  and she's the same size as my son!"" - *bitch*. Apparently he's already 16 pounds. He looked like it too. Granted  he's a boy and I realize baby boys tend to be a little bigger than baby girls  but that's usually with babies their own age... these two have a big age difference! According to her charts  she's in the 10th percentile for weight I feel like I'm doing something wrong here.""",6

"(Forewarning...some TMI stuff in here. Long story above the line, short version after)
My wife just gave birth to our son 8 weeks ago. He's perfect and healthy and great. 
My wife has ulcerative colitis, which up until just before the son was born was in remission. I mostly credit the specific carbohydrate diet for helping her with that. 
About a week or two before he was born she got some very early symptoms of a flare-up, but she had also broken her diet a bit, so she got strict again. 
The week son was born, my inlaws came to stay for 2 weeks and they added an enormous amount of stress to our house. Combined with her hormones going crazy and her immune system kicking back up, she started to get a flareup. 
After my inlaws left, my mom came to stay with us for a month. My mom is super nurturing and understanding and has helped a lot. Within about two weeks, her flare-up started to subside some and day by day she seemed to be improving very slowly.
We don't know what it was, but suddenly this week she's taken an about face. Tuesday she was a little constipated but okay. Yesterday she had softer stool than she had been, and there was a bit more blood mixed in than there had been in the previous week. 
All of the sudden today, she's had 5 loose stools with a lot of blood, abdominal spasms, and just overall heavier symptoms with almost no run-up to them.
She's become extremely attached to breastfeeding and is absolutely a mess whenever she thinks about having to stop, but I think has accepted that it may be necessary for her to take drugs to help her, and we will need to switch to formula for that time. She's also not wanting to have a GI insist that she gets on Remicade or Humira, since there's substantial side effects from both, the latter showing possible birth defects, and we will possibly have another child in the future. She's also allergic to asacol drugs, and 6MP didn't help her. She basically considers prednisone to be the devil after having been on it a few times and really really doesn't want to get on it again. 

Right now, I've got a cold that I don't want to pass to either her or the baby, so I'm trying to stay away as much as possible and letting my mom help, but it's absolutely tearing apart my heart. This year, since we found out she was pregnant, I've developed some anxiety issues, and while I'm trying to be strong for her"" I'm going to have a hard time keeping it together if this goes on long. At this point I'm willing to do whatever it takes to help her heal. Do any of you have a gastroenterologist that helps you deal with the disease without trying to force drugs on you? If we have to fly anywhere in the US (or maybe even overseas)...I'm not really leaving options off the table right now. *** 1. Anyone here have UC and managed to get out of a flareup not long after your child was born? How did you do it? 2. Anyone have a GI that doesn't insist that diet has nothing to do with your UC and doesn't try to put you on remicade and humira in his first breath when you see him in his office?""",6
"(I was told this would be better received here)
To my son, 

You're too young to know this, but I am ill-equipped to be a parent. I am clumsy, forgetful, irrational, and fearful. Since you are only 4 months old, all you know is that I am God. One day, sooner than I'd like to admit, you will find out that Daddy is not Superman and Mommy is not God. We are two people who were never supposed to be able to have children. When we were blessed with you, life changed forever. We are trying to do all the right things to make sure you grow up well-balanced and happy. While you're young, you are going to think that I know everything and can do no wrong. As much as I would like to admit that this is true and that I am the mom that all other moms strive to become, I can't. And for that, I am sorry. You are the greatest thing that has ever happened in my life and you deserve the best mother in the world. That is not me.
I love to sleep. I love to eat greasy food and sugary snacks. I enjoy watching television over going outside and jogging. I am quiet and reserved, an introvert. Daddy plays video games all day. We don't keep our dishes clean, our laundry folded or our floors vacuumed. We will not be setting the most positive or healthiest example for you. What we will do is make sure your life is filled with love and support for whatever you want to do. We will do our best to teach you how to be respectful of others, respectful of your elders, and respectful to yourself. We don't make very much money, and what we do make, we don't handle very responsibly. So you may not have the most up-to-date clothes or the name brand yogurt in your lunchbox, but I can promise you that you will never be cold or hungry.

I want to promise you the perfect life with no worries, no sadness, no pain...but I can't. And for that, you deserve an apology. An apology for all the things I'm not. I am not smart, I am not organized, I am not the best role model. You will get hurt, and you will be sad. What I can promise you is that the pain and sadness will not last. I can promise that the good times will vastly outweigh the bad. I can promise you that I will always be your mother, and I will love you more than I love myself.
And for that, I will not apologize.",6
"(I'm not a mom [but hope to be one day], so I hope this question is okay. If not, please tell me a better place for it)
I was reading another thread on Reddit where moms were talking about how they don't have any time for anything now that they're parents, and a few were saying how they hadn't brushed their hair in days because they have zero time for anything except the baby. I realize being a parent is a big commitment, but is it really work work work 24/7? Even a newborn eventually has had enough to eat and wants to take a nap, right? As far as I know, you just have to make sure they're fed and keep them clean. I know you'll have to repeat through the day, but what fills up the rest of that time? Is having zero free time an exaggeration, or is there a lot to baby care I'm just unaware of?
EDIT- Thanks for the responses, I'm reading each one even if I don't reply to them all. Just wanted to note that I do have a husband who will (theoretically) be doing half the work, and both our moms will probably also lend a hand from time to time. ",6
"(Original thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/215344/newborn_potentially_tonguetied/.compact)
We were correct. She is tongue tied. 
When I brought it up with the child nurse, she looked at her tongue and confirmed it straight away. She was really concerned that it wasnt picked up at the hospital, or at the 'health check' before we were discharged.
There is a local hospital that does the procedure but the waiting list is long, so we were given the names of three other doctors in  the state that will do the procedure. We have an appoinment for friday, and hope that the doctor will do the procedure there and then. The appointment will cost us $200 (instead of for free at the hospital) but it is worth it. This way we hope she will be able to feed freely by the weekend. 
Until then, we have been instructed to alternate between breastfeeding and expressed breastmilk in a bottle. The nurse lent us a industrial strength double pump which i working (but I hate). But atleast we know that she is getting enough milk now, and my milk is coming in properly. 
Thank you everyone for your support, opinions, personal experiences and shoulder to cry on.",6
"(Sorry in advance for the wall of text)
My little girl is 7 1/2 months. She was sleeping through 6:30-6:00 since around 2 months of age. In the last 3 weeks she has been harder to settle and has been waking at 4am on the dot, either crying or just wide awake ready to start her day. We have tried the following to get her to sleep through again:
 Keeping the room at a constant warm temperature
Earlier bed time/later bed time
More/less nap during the day (she averages 5-6 hours sleep during the day)
More food during the day...loading her up before bed time 
Dream feed @ 10am
Going in and patting/shushing and giving a dummy
Bringing her into our bed
We have tried all this over the past 3 weeks. She is teething, but you don't hear a sound from her until 4am and then she is wide awake. 
It is winter here, so her room is still dark and it's black outside. 
,Any advice?? Do I need to be more consistent or let her cry? :( Some people say it's a phase and to ride it out. Some people say fix it now or else she will wake at 4am for years to come :/",6
"* I plan on breastfeeding past 6 months, and *gasp* until two years.* I rock my baby to sleep. * I co-sleep.* I haven't gave my baby water, formula, apple juice, rice cereal yet.* I don't plan on giving him anything pre-made/store bought, besides organic fruits and vegetables made into baby food.* I hold him too much.* I don't let him cry himself to sleep.* I want to raise my child my way, not anyone else's. Keep in mind my child is 3 months old, apparently by the time he is a year old I will be calling her begging her to help me because I've messed him up, and she's just going to say you did this to yourself"". """,6
"* It's worth trying to get your little one to take cool/cold milk/formula.  We gradually went from warm to room temp to cool to cold over a few weeks, eventually he was great with cool/cold milk/formula.  YMMV.  
* If/when you use formula, get something like [this pitcher](http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Browns-Formula-Mixing-Pitcher/dp/B001I481LM/), and measure the powder by weight if you have a kitchen scale (typically ~130-135g for 30oz).  Fill the pitcher with 30oz water, place on scale and Tare it, add powder to match amount of water.  It saves a lot of time and scooping. 
* Give your (sitting/crawling age) baby his/her morning milk in a straw cup (we used [this one](http://www.amazon.com/ZoLi-BOT-Sippy-Cup-Orange/dp/B0031E1GEQ/)) while you get ready in the morning and s/he is within eyesight.  He's occupied, you save time getting ready by using the time to feed your little one.  This only works when s/he is comfortable with the straw cup, obviously.

*sigh* I'm probably thinking way too much about this...
My son is 4 months old now and I've been breastfeeding and pumping the whole time exept for a short time in the beginning when I gave him a little formula every day. Everything's been going well, and I hadn't been planning to try any rice cereal or anything until 6 months, since that's how long the AAP recommends exclusively breastfeeding. The last pediatrician we went to said we could go ahead with solids, but I didn't really like her, and it contradicted a lot of stuff I read, so wasn't planning on going ahead yet anyway. He's seemed content with what he's been getting, to me anyway. My parents have been having to feed him a little more on the nights I work, but I figured it was a growth spurt or something...and I haven't noticed him acting any more hungry at night when I'm home.
Basically, a couple of days ago my husband asked me why we haven't started him on rice cereal or anything yet, and my parents, who do the babysitting, said they think it's time because they've observed that he hasn't been happy after eating his usual amounts until they go ahead and give him more (I just figured growth spurt). I went ahead and told them to go ahead and get some rice cereal, and he had a little today, mixed with my milk. He definitely seemed interested...but he's 4 months old and teething...he's generally interested in putting everything in his mouth. He did push it out, which I read is either a sign he's not ready, or just something babies do. Lord I've read so much.
Is this too early? And is rice cereal ok? I'm reading so many mixed things it's making my head hurt. I can't really tell if he's ready or not because this whole month I've been working 12hr night shifts (that's almost over, thank goodness). Nights off or not, I only get a few really good waking hours with him every day, so I feel like maybe I could actually be missing the cues that he's ready for solid food...and this being our first child, I don't really know the cues anyway.
Oh, also, my son is a pretty big boy. He was 17lbs 5oz at his last appointment on the 7th this month. I don't know if that makes a difference. I've heard some people say they were told to go ahead and give rice cereal to their babies pretty early because they were so big. But then I've also heard that doesn't matter, it's all about when their little guts are all developed.
I know y'all are an absolute fountain of information, so any advice, tips, good sources about this? Help?",2
"**Food:** I can't get my son to eat anything out of his comfort zone. If I give him something that isn't one of thing things on the list below, he will either pick it up and squish it in his hands, put it in his mouth and spit it out or just throw it to the floor. He refuses anything spoon fed. He will not even try it, he just shakes his head and pushes it away. Occasionally I will trick him into opening his mouth and once I can get it in, he will taste it, but 99% of the time he spits it out. He does eat cheese, bread, crackers, turkey hotdogs, hard boiled egg yolks, bananas, mix, puffs, and occasionally yogurt. I've tried every food I can think of. I try to give him two foods, not on the comfort list, a day. I cycled around with 'new' foods every few weeks. I've tried going back to baby food, but he doesn't want the spoon. I've tried having him feed himself with the spoon, but he doesn't get it yet. I've tried where he feeds me a piece of the food and then it's his turn to eat. This works sometimes, but he usually puts it in his mouth and spits it back out. I've also tried giving him whatever I'm eating during a meal. Sometimes he even points to our food and says Mmmmm, so I give him some and he squishes it or spits it out! I'm at a loss. Do I just ride this out and eventually he will eat other foods? **Bath:** He loves the bath, he hates having his hair washed, specifically the rinsing part. He also will not sit down in the tub. There is no pain or anything, he just wants to stand up. I've tried a few things, but every time I start to rinse his hair he tries to jump out of the tub. I've used a shower head, a cup to pour the water over his hair and a battery powered baby shower head. Any suggestions on how to get him to sit down or wash his hair without him jumping over the side of the tub?",1
"**this may be triggering if you have an ED** Ladies, I have had problems with my weight since I was in middle school. When we decided to start trying, I was able to completely stop with the anorexia and bulimia. There was no way in HELL I was going to endanger my child. (The self-control I have when it comes to taking care of my baby is amazing...) The problem is now, 4 months after my baby was born. We tried breastfeeding, but I barely make any milk, so we are mainly doing formula. (I could stop with the breastfeeding right now, and calorie-wise it would not make a difference for the baby.) That was the main thing keeping me from starving/vomiting again. Now... I want so badly to keep myself healthy, because I don't want my children to grow up seeing my ED. I can't though. I keep skipping breakfast, and I can't manage to keep my dinner down most days. Lunch is sporadic on the days I don't work. My husband is currently clueless, since we work opposite shifts. I am really just feeling so lost right now. I can't seem to get myself under control. I want to be healthy for my child, but I HATE what I see in the mirror. (I should add that I gained 15 pounds shortly before i got pregnant, then gained 50 pounds with my pregnancy due to some sugar problems.) I am 30 pounds higher than my normal weight, and 40 pounds higher than my ideal. The main point here is looking for some help from other Mamas who have gone through this... or even just to get some of this off my chest. Thanks for reading, mommit. Throw away account, obviously. My husband is a redditor, and I think he looks at Mommit sometimes. He knows my normal user name. :) TL;DR: struggling with my EDs and very unhappy with it, need some advice/to get this off my chest.",6
"**TL;DR Husband works 40hrs/wk, I stay home with our newborn. I feel overwhelmed, he thinks I'm lazy.  Who's right?**
My husband & I recently welcomed our first child. Before I got pregnant we both decided that I would stay at home with the baby for at least the first year, longer if at all possible.  
After a high-risk pregnancy I gave birth to a healthy son and we came home to start our new life as a family.  
I'm exclusively nursing the boy. Right after we brought him home, my husband mentioned a few times that he wished he could help with feedings so he could have that bonding experience with our son.  We talked about it & decided that I'd pump some extra so Dad could feed him via bottle for an evening feed. For about a week he would give the baby a bottle after dinner while I pumped.  
This is where things started to unravel a bit; he needed both hands to feed so he couldn't browse the internet for the 20-30 minutes it took the baby to eat & burp.  Dad started sighing & whining I guess..."" when I'd ask if he was ready to break out the bottle.  Then he began to decline the bottle feeds; after a few days of that I stopped asking.  Now baby is 3 months old  just coming out of the newborn stage 
Here's a breakdown of my day:  
4am baby wakes to eat  I bring him to bed where he eats & we doze for a couple hours. 6am Dad gets up for work  Dad calls on break from work  we chat. 9:30 or so  diaper change  baby nurses again  takes his morning nap for an hour - he cries if I try to put him in his bassinet so he naps on my lap.  11am baby wakes  diaper change  more books/playing - sometimes he'll sit in his baby seat for 10 or 15min so I can throw together lunch for myself & wolf it down. Noon Dad calls on his lunch break  I nurse baby and try to entertain Dad.  Between 1pm-3pm baby nurses constantly  then has his afternoon nap. Dad comes home a little after 3pm and surfs the 'net for an hour - he gets grimy at work so he can't/won't hold the baby until he's had a shower. 4:30 Dad showers  I nurse baby diaper change and by 5pm he's ready to take the baby so I can start dinner.  I throw together something quick & simple wolf down my food  and take the baby so he can nurse and so Dad can (leisurely) eat. By this point it's 6:30. We play with baby for 30 minutes to an hour. At 7:30 I get baby's bath ready while Dad gets baby ready. I bathe baby get him diapered & in his pajamas 
At this point I can then worry about laundry vacuuming On weekends I get a little more help in that Dad will hold/play with baby while I do housework but he gets cranky if it interrupts Skyrim for too long and will immediately hand off the baby if he fusses because ""he's hungry.""  Dad sleeps til noon on the weekends The biggest issue in my day is the inability to put baby down.  He has a sensitivity to cow's milk and soy which wasn't diagnosed until he was 2 months old.  If I eat anything with dairy or soy the proteins pass through my breastmilk and give baby gastrointestinal problems.  For his first 2 months he was very colicky and needed to be held/soothed constantly.  Now that I'm not eating dairy or soy he's much happier and I'm working on getting him used to being put down sometimes.  For huge chunks of the day
As for my husband the only ""chore"" he does is to take the trash cans to the street once a week We've had discussions & even an argument about this and what it boils down to is that since he works 40 hours a week he will do zero housework.  It's my job to do all the cooking I contend that my ""workday"" is 24 hours a day 7 days a week and it's not out of line for me to ask him to do a little more around the house.  Even handling dinner a few nights a week and putting his dirty laundry/dishes where they belong would be a huge help! I've also explained that once baby is a little older and can play on his own I'll have more freedom to handle things - he still refuses to help me even on a temporary basis.  Am I being unreasonable for wanting some help? Is he expecting too much? How do other parents handle this??""",6
"**TL;DR** **My ex's mother spanked my eighteen month old for spitting her food out. My ex said he would talk to his mother, but I'm not sure he's taking this seriously, and I doubt she will listen to him.  Am I overreacting? Should I say something? What do you think?**

(Sorry for the wall of text, I have a hard time using few words. This is mostly just elaboration, the gist is in the TL;DR)

Long backstory short: My daughter is eighteen months and her father and I are no longer together. We had an amicable separation, we remained friends, and I have primary placement, while he takes her when he can, because we live in different towns. He lives with his mother (this is relevant). 

So I go to pick her up from her dads house on Sunday and get the usual spiel DD was great  we love spending time with her  we'll take her anytime  ect."" And then something catches my attention. Her dads mom says ""We fed her a hamburger ...excuse me? You did *what*?!  That's right  everyone. She spanked my year and a half year old because she wasn't eating her dinner. I'm absolutely livid at this point and I have a hard time keeping my mouth shut about her parenting opinions so I let DD's Dad deal with her. I called him and told him that it was absolutely unacceptable for his mother to hit our daughter. Besides the fact she is not my daughters parent and that she absolutely should not be being spanked at this age. I didn't really get the feel that he was taking me seriously at all  which really irritates me. So now I'm at a loss. Am I blowing this whole things out of proportion? Am I wrong to not want her dads mom spanking her at this age or at all? Should I just let it go? I just don't know what to do and I'm so upset about this whole situation. ",6
"**TL;DR** in title**Back Story** Just had LO 4 months ago. I was living with my mom at the time and decided to move in with my bf because there were way too many issues with her. My boyfriend (22) works as a Technician full time and sometimes overtime. I (19) decided to go to school full time with the GI Bill (scholarship) paying me more than my boyfriend gets a month. We live with his mom, stepdad, his brother, and his brother's gf. My bf and I have been living in the same room with baby for the past 3 months.

His brother (22) also works, but all he does is play video games and smoke weed (in the garage, not in the house) when he's at home. He is extremely lazy. His girlfriend (22), however, loves the whole house wife"" living. She works and has a part-time job as a model. She does all her boyfriend's laundry †etc etc. She was doing this for everyone at first**Back Story on My Boyfriend**† I love him I really do. But sometimes the guy could really use a reality check just to see how it would be if I weren't around for him and the baby (not saying I'm gonna leave grocery shopping keeping track of calendar dates etc.. I have to do all that. I started putting things on his list of things to do like getting the Birth Certificate done or cleaning the car. Guess who had to do both of those things... Oh but when he cleans the kitchen or cleans the room he deserves a fucking gold medal. What's silly is I still have to clean those rooms because he only did most of the dishes and he only gathered all of our crap and put it on the bed or my desk. But he does take very good care of LO. We pretty much have it split down the middle there. So what exactly is my problem? I just would like a little appreciation.

"**TL;DR:** Daughter is a tyrant. Need help. My daughter is 16 months old and I am at the end of my rope with her today. I've never in my life been frustrated by her behavior until this day. I got her two cans of those Gerber Puffs things and when we got home, she demanded I give them to her and proceeded to dump the contents of *both* cans all over my coffee table and living room floor. While I was cleaning it up, she managed to get onto my kitchen table and empty the can of Puffs I'd already refilled all over the kitchen table and floor. I only realized she was on the table because I heard an alarmed cry from the kitchen and walked in to see her legs dangling off the edge as she struggled to get back up onto the table. She had pushed one of my chairs over to the table and climbed on! So, I took one of my baby gates and I gated it off and she shrieked about it. I actually had to step outside to cool down. After this, I was once again cleaning up the Puffs off the floor and I come from the kitchen into the living room and she has her juice upside-down dumping it all over the coffee table!!! I actually said her name in an angry voice and glared at her, which I never do. She doesn't normally make me mad, you know? Aside from today's incident, she: takes off her diaper and laughs like it's a game when you tell her to stop. In fact, any time she does something bad and you tell her to stop, she laughs and continues on as if you hadn't said anything. She has given me a black eye from headbutting me. She hits, she bites. She grabs at my laptop which she *knows* she isn't allowed to touch because in October, she managed to fry the hard drive by pounding the keys. Any time you don't do what she wants, when she wants, she cries like you are skinning her alive. She insists on being carried *everywhere*. The other night I was trying to cook and she was pulling my pants down while having a tantrum because she wanted me to hold her and I was at the stove. It was too dangerous to hold her right then! I can't hardly get her to eat any real food, either. I have tried slapping her hand which works but doesn't work for long. What else can I do? She is only 16 months old. I don't know what kind of discipline you can even give a baby her age. Any help is welcome. **Edit: I don't have time to individually reply to each comment but thank you all so much for your advice and I am going to do the things you have suggested!

"**TLDR going in for amnio consult. Baby measuring big, may need to induce early. Need to know details about it. **
I'm currently 34 weeks pregnant with my 2nd child. My first pregnancy was a cake walk. Aside from gestational diabetes with was solely diet controlled and some spotting my first trimester, I couldn't have asked for a better or easier pregnancy. 
This baby, not so much. I have GD again, it's diet controlled. I've been having false labor for the last 2 weeks and was actually in the ER on Dec 30th and again 2 weeks ago. Both times for back pain so bad I couldn't walk which apparently is what started the false labor. I've also had gas/indigestion so bad I couldn't even drink water. I am now prescribed meds for both the gas and the back pain, and luckily haven't had anymore back pain since the last ER trip. In addition, a tumor was found and removed during my 2nd trimester, everything went smoothly and it was complication free. 
In addition to all of that, my baby is measuring 4 weeks early, 90th percentile for head size. My blood sugar numbers have been great, and my doctor assures me that size is not due to my GD since my numbers are so good (I eat whatever I want and still have a under 120 number 2 hours later, as long as I don't gorge, I'm fine.) I've also lost a total of 35lbs this pregnancy, but since the baby is growing fine, and I lost weight the first time around, no one is concerned. 
Because of his size, my doctor brought up having an amnio to check to make sure his lungs are developed so that early delivery can be on the table. The hospital's policy is no early inductions until the 39 week mark without the ok of a perinatal specialist, which means an amnio. There is the slight chance that after viewing my chart and having an exam the perinatal will say inducing is fine without the amnio, but odds are they'll require it. 
Anyone who's had one this late, how does it work. I know it involved a needle going into your stomach, but that's it. Does it hurt? Are you numb? What kinds of side effects can I expect, and risks? I'm having the consultation with the specialist on Thursday (Happy Valentine's for me, right?) but I'd like to have a little bit of an idea of what to ask and expect going in. I do know that my OB won't send me for the amnio until I am 36-37 weeks, so I for sure won't be expected to make the decision in office to be done right then. ",6

"*When my two kids were born, I created each an email account, a la [this Google ad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vkVHijdQk).*
*I recently sent them these 10 life lessons"". These are the most important things I could think of to live a happy life.*
**What would you add?**
1.Treat everyone with respect‚Ä¶ everyone. Even people you don't like or people who may not like you.
2.You will come across terrible mean
3.Think positive thoughts. Train yourself to think productively. If you think to yourself ""Today is going to be a terrible day."" All of the sudden  you feel terrible. If you say to yourself ""Today is going to be an amazing day."" All of the sudden
4.You are responsible for your own life and your own happiness. If things aren't going your way  fix it. If you are unhappy
5.Everyone loves seeing you smile. So do that a lot.
6.Nothing truly worth doing is easy. The most rewarding things in the world require hard work lots of it. So learn to enjoy the hard work and not just the outcome. Otherwise you‚Äôll spend all of your time waiting for fulfillment that will never come.
7.Stay healthy. Exercise and eat good foods. You'll feel better you'll live longer
8.Every once in a while challenge yourself to do something you don't think is possible. Working to achieve a goal and achieving it feels great
9.Never stop learning. Every person you meet knows many things that you don't. [Bill Nye] Try to find out what they are. Knowledge builds on itself exponentially. If you know A then it makes it easier to know B. If you know both A and B
10.Stay out of debt. If you need to take out loans treat paying it off as an emergency. There is no stress quite like financial stress. Money is not just for buying things. Money is your time and energy. Every dollar you spend is a portion of your life that you used to earn that dollar. Spend wisely and make sure your spending habits align with what is most important to you.""",6

For the past few months he has been on the following food schedule:
* nursing first thing in the morning (7 a.m.) 
* breakfast ~1.5 hrs later (usually 4 small sweet potato pancakes, wheat toast with peanut butter, or similar grain-related item; some yogurt or yogurt puffs and some fruit) 
* 4 oz breastmilk bottle before morning nap, or nursing on weekends
* lunch ~1.5 hrs after waking up (good mix of meat item, fruit, veg, cheese and green puffs or mummum) * 4 oz breastmilk bottle before afternoon nap, or nursing on weekends
* evening snack of basically anything he didn't eat earlier, so if he preferred his fruit to veg at lunch he will have the remaining veg for snack, etc.
* nursing before bedtime (around 6:30-7 p.m.)
He will move to the next class up at daycare this fall, and they don't allow for bottles. His doctor has OK'd moving to whole milk in a sippy cup as a beverage with one meal a day, though I will still continue to nurse in the morning and at bedtime for the time being. I also know that we need to step up feeding him actual dinners instead of small snacks in the evening, so that will go parallel to trying to ditch the bottle.
I have no idea how to cut out his bottles during the day. I know I should mix half breastmilk and half whole milk in his sippy until he gets used to it, but do I just cut out bottles cold turkey so he'll give the mixed milk a chance? Do I also stop nursing during the day on weekends? It's the quickest way for me to get him to sleep, but he'll nap for my husband without boobs or bottle.
I appreciate any and all advice!",6
"[My wife](/u/mrs_jwhardcastle) and I have been discussing this off and on for a while.  She is a social worker, and she spends a good portion of her free time reading the news about how dumb parents kill their children.  So, long story short, she has almost no patience for this topic.  I'm looking for some nuance.  Or, perhaps, I'll find out I'm a lunatic and I'll admit I was wrong.
I try to be a realist.  My wife isn't superhuman, and neither am I.  I believe that there are certain **highly limited** circumstances under which it is acceptable to secure your infant in the car for up to 3-5 minutes, because to remove him from the car makes it likely he will wake up, and makes it impossible for you to accomplish what you need to do (no, it's not always possible to leave your child with a caretaker while you run quick errands).  Example: dropping off laundry at the dry cleaners, because it is too much to carry the laundry and the child at the same time.
My argument goes a little something like this:
* 10 weeks old.  No, it's not OK for a 2 year old, but at this age he won't be able to cause havoc, secured in his car seat, and [covered](http://moneysavingmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/car-seat-canopy.jpg).
* The engine should be off, and the car should be locked, windows up.
* The car should be constantly in your field of vision.  Example: only if you park in the space five feet from the door at the dry cleaners with the big windows.
* It should be cool out (between 40 and 60 degrees) because temperatures can rise up to 20 degrees in a car in just 10 minutes.
* Set a timer for four minutes.  If it goes off, stop what you are doing and go get the child, no exceptions.
* Don't do it if it is [against the law](http://www.kidsandcars.org/state-laws.html).  In our state, it is prohibited *if the car is out of sight*, but not prohibited outright.
Every story you hear on the news is about adults who leave a child in the car for long, long periods of time.
As a warning to others who would consider breaking these guidelines, [heatstroke is the leading cause of non-crash So what do you all think?  Unacceptable under any circumstances?  Or an occasional necessity under strict guidelines?""",6

Thank you mommitors for all your replies.  I think I had some sort of stomach bug on top of morning sickness.  The next morning after I posted I woke up and threw up everything (what little there was).  This was past internet advice stage so I called the obgyn right away and went in to see him.  He prescribed Zofran pump, I was already on oral Zofran but he was confident that the fancy pump would work better.  It takes a day or two to get the pump delivered and set up.  The rest of that day I threw up a couple more times and hardly ate anything.  Luckily my mother in law was able to come take care of the baby and I. The next day I woke up and had an appetite for the first time in more than a week.  I was able to eat and keep food down with hardly any nausea and I hadn't even take a Zofran.The day after this I talked to the Dr again and we decided to cancel the Zofran pump stick to just regular oral Zofran, which I hardly take at all any more.  I've been steadily improving and have a lot of appetite but I get full faster than before. Weight wise I've gained back maybe one or two of the pounds I lost during this episode, but I still need to gain more to get back on track.
The current baby got speed weened and now she's happy with formula.  She doesn't like the taste as much but really likes the quantity.
All of your suggestions have been really helpful.  I continue to try all the different ways to bolster my appetite.

Thank you for all the kind words.  Everyone is doing a lot better.  
The first few days were rough.  He continued to refuse medicine and would get extremely, irrationally angry.  Eventually we had to take him to his pediatrician and have them inject antibiotics into his thighs (two shots administered simultaneously) because we couldn't get anything nasty tasting by.  I slept with him in his bed for the first two nights.  He was restless.  He'd flail in his sleep and sometime exclaim, No!"" out of his sleep.  Nightmares The 2nd night was strange.  He was acting really erratically...like literally crazy.  He'd lie down in his bed and we'd cover him with a favorite blanket of his and he'd jump up and forcefully take it off and throw it on the floor and then matter of factly go back into his sleeping position.  He'd ""pet"" the night stand next to his bed like he was petting a dog.  He wasn't treating it like a dog but he was just running his hand over and over it.  None of the normal evening rituals were possible.  Even though the evening was so odd  he slept better that night.  Naturally my wife couldn't sleep and starting googling concussion symptoms.  This freaked us out a lot.  I cried a lot the next morning because I was pretty convinced I broke our son forever. We did successfully get him on regular doses of ibuprofen because we always set aside juice boxes as a special occasion drink.  Usually he'll get apple juice and water at a 50/50 ratio.  Once the pain killers started  things were a lot better.  After a lot of trial and error we figured out what he'd eat:  soft shell pasta.  That's pretty much been his breakfast lunch and dinner.  We've tried cream of wheat and soups and bread and butter and except for the occasional bread and butter We went to the dentist on Monday and screwed up because we thought this first dentist was a pediatric dentist.  It wasn't.  She checked him out and didn't see any fractures  which was nice That 2nd dentist was just what we needed.  There were staff who were used to dealing with children  a fun waiting room  but the trauma of the fall actually caused his teeth to start pointing off in opposite directions. :(  So  now he has a gap  but according to the dentist  whenever these baby teeth fall out  the adult teeth will come in straight.  Someone here made a comment to make sure I find the tooth because he could have swallowed it.  I took it to heart  that was a good point.  There was also a cracked molar and the dentist bonded it with this ""paint"" and what looked like a UV light.  I was pretty nervous he was going to brush up against a sensitive spot but he never did.  My son got a special prize from the dentist and fell asleep on the way home.  As an interesting side note  my wife had brought home this book [Just Going To The Dentist](http://www.amazon.com/Dentist-Little-Critter-Golden-Look-Look/dp/0307125831) from this town fair where a local dentist was giving them out and it ended up being one of his favorite books and he knew it back and forth prior to all this.  I really think it helped his understanding of what was going on. So  here we are I'll still never put him up on my shoulders again  nor will I ever do it for my 4 month old.  The risk/reward ratio just simply hopelessly out of balance there My wife's forgiven me  if she ever held anything against me at all to forgive.  She's had to ask me a few times to forgive myself. I feel a little silly making as big of a deal of this compared to parents of children with terminal cancer or some undiagnosed exotic disease.  I wish there were some life-lesson to pull out of this experience other than  ""Don't be a dumb-ass.  Don't be clumsy.""  Maybe",6

Like a lead weight was in there. Typical period pain... but no period. Now I'm worried about prolapse. Has anyone had this sensation? What came of it? Yes, I know I should talk to a doctor. I don't have insurance right now and planned parenthood is a haul. I will eventually speak to a doctor (ESPECIALLY if it comes back).",6
"[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/xz3r2/next_time_you_eat_at_a_restaurant) in /r/WTF made me wonder what the general consensus among actual parents is with regards to this dilemma.  What do you do when you go places and have to change a diaper but there is no place to do it?
Here are a couple of scenarios that I've been in:
Scenario A:  you are traveling, far away from home.  You don't have a car, and are a long way away from anyplace such as a hotel where you could take care of business.  You go to a restaurant and your kid starts grunting.  Upon inpsection, the bathroom is a) tiny, b) provides no elevated surface to change a baby, and c) is filthy.  What do you do?
Scenario B: Same as before, except now you are a father on his own.  The men's bathroom doesn't have a changing table, but you know (for whatever reason, maybe you've been to this place with your wife) that the women's bathroom does.  What do you do?
For both scenarios, what responsibility does the restaurant owner have?",6
"[This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLhC6NSlDzY#t=00m24s) pretty accurately sums up how I feel at mealtimes, especially dinnertime, with my 3-year-old daughter.  Even if we're serving something she loves (peanut butter and jelly, mac and cheese, steamed carrots, apples, cheese), she usually only has a few small bites, and then sits there staring at her food and/or playing with her silverware without eating anymore (or demanding that we feed her instead of feeding herself).  If she does happen to finish her food, it takes her anywhere from an hour to 3 hours (!) to do so.
We've tried offering her dessert if she eats all her food, and she tells us she doesn't want dessert.  We've tried taking away privileges like watching an episode of Caillou before bed if she doesn't finish her meal, and it doesn't seem to faze her.  We've tried telling her that eating her dinner will make her big, healthy, and strong so that she can ride the big water slides at the water park (something she *really* wants to do), and most nights she just sits there pouting and staring at her still-full plate.  We've tried both gentle and firm approaches, and it seems like what we've done thus far has had little to no effect.
We try to eat together as a family as much as possible, but I don't get home from work until about 8:15 at night, well after dinner time, and most of the nights I am home for dinner my husband works.  Even if we're eating as a family, she still barely touches her food and takes hours to eat what I would consider a sufficient amount (say, half of what we serve her in a kiddie-size bowl).
She's been stubborn about mealtimes since she was about 2 and a half (she'll be 4 in July), and it's incredibly frustrating.  My fear is that this is moving beyond simply a phase and becoming a habit; tonight she told me she'd rather go to bed than eat her dinner.  How can we get her to eat properly when she doesn't seem to care about the incentives/disincentives we offer her?",1
"10 Things I've Learned From My Son:

1- pooping is hard, and it is quite possible to fall asleep while doing it
2- the true capacity of a Pampers Stay Dry consists of lies and deceit.
3- cats are toys. Computers are toys. Plugs are toys.
Everything is a toy. 4- if its yours, it automatically is owned by baby. Phone? His. XBox controller? His. King Sized bed? His.
5- cooking utensils are instruments, and are not to be used for cooking.
6- entertainment during meal time is a must. Singing, dancing, toys, funny faces - everything.
7- if you're breastfeeding, you have little control over your baby pulling your clothing up or down to get to the goods. Just accept it. You'll end up flashing someone.
8- a sippy cup is a sippy cup unless its a rattle or a bottle. 
9- naps are not dictating, but happen by chance. Leap upon those chances like a starving man onto a four course dinner. Carefully, but with abandon.
10- any noise will not wake baby up unless you make it. Prepare by unwrapping candy bars/crackers/whatever for snacks and do not crunch. Merely let the food dissolve in your mouth and swallow quieter than a fly fart.
Ah, life. By the by... I wrote this while praying to whatever God would listen, that my son would fall back asleep. He fell asleep while pooping and I had to wake him up to change him. :(",6

"30/F here. I have always known that I do not want kids for a host of reasons that are not especially relevant here. What changed is I have met the man that I am going to marry, and more importantly, that I am willing to parent children with for the rest of my life.
I am in search of advice on how to prepare my body to host miniature people within it. I will likely conceive in about 2-4 years.
Currently I am a smoker, I drink on more than the occasional night out, I have no health problems (rarely sick, no allergies, not even eyesight problems), I am a bit overweight, not obese.
**I will quit smoking and lose weight before trying to get pregnant** so I am looking for advice that is not generally common knowledge. I have no health care (and  have not since I was 18) so please give me the advice you have gotten from doctors and personal information that you knew/wish you had known. Also, advice and funny stories about what to expect for the child rearing is greatly appreciated! 
I also want to pass [this](http://assholebaby.com/) along if anyone here has not already seen it, as I think this silly approach to child rearing will help me keep my sanity through the adventure of parenting.
EDIT: I should probably mention that there are nearly zero small children in my life, and I have had almost no experience with babies/small children. None of my friends have children, and I rarely spend time with my little nephews (who are new to the family, as they are my brother's girlfriend's kids from a previous marriage). I have a step daughter, but as I am dating the father, we only spend about 4-5 whole days and nights with her out of the month. She is great, and may have played a part in my near-sudden willingness to procreate. So I guess I am saying, **explain parenting to me as if I am a 5 year old.**",6

"A few weeks back, at least a month ago, my 3 year old randomly threw up in the middle of the night. No biggie, just the one time. We took all precautions and cleaned the house like crazy. Exactly a week later he did it again. Then again two nights ago.
It's always been the majority in his bed the one time, with maybe another very minor leftovers"" liquidy one. His diapers follow with at least one nasty poop. No one else in the family has ever shown any symptoms to match. (Although earlier this week hubby was having tummy aches.) Also this past week our preschool had a confirmed break out of norovirus in another class. After those first original two pukes I got a little concerned and started to keep a food diary  wondering if this could be a food allergy of some kind. Two nights ago he had whipped cream on his pancakes (best buy date is next month) and no one else did. Wanted to mention he was a big poker as a baby. Always puked after breastfeeding for a very long time 6months+). Thoughts? I'm not one to rush to a doctor because it doesn't seem serious  plus they'd probably start me doing what I already am. Adding: not sure if it matters  but we're potty training and he's not been pooping regularly. """,6

"A little background first: last semester, when my son was 4-7 months old, he went to this babysitter. He had hard days when he was teething, but in general did very well there. Then I took him out of her care for the summer (why spend the crazy amount of money each week for care when I'll be home to watch him, plus, I really wants to do the stay at home mom thing while I had the time off). I should probably mention that over the summer I have nursed him on demand, picked him up when he cries almost very time, and given up twice on trying to get him out of our bed and into his crib because it just so hard for me to listen to him cry. And this kid will cry forever if I let him. So I haven't been doing much to prevent him from being spoiled and now I can see how it's backfiring. He's so incredibly clingy. Next week I go back to college full time. So I enrolled him with the same sitter and signed him up for a week earlier than school to give him some time to adjust. It hasn't been going well.   


For the past two days, he screams when I leave and cries off and on for hours and when it comes time to feed him, he won't take a bottle from her. And it's not just her. Anytime I try to hand him over to someone else and leave the room, instant tears and nonstop crying. So the first day this week I planned on being a short one because I knew he'd have a hard time. Two or three hours after dropping him off, I got a text from the sitter saying he won't eat. So I came over to give him his bottle. Second day, same thing, only he wouldn't even take the bottle from me he was so upset so I had to nurse him. Today, I even stayed away a little longer but he wasn't eating and wouldn't even let he sitter hold him without crying even more. So I came back over and fed him his bottle and stayed the rest of the time that he's supposed to be over there, trying to get him to sleep so I could leave. But when I got him to sleep and tried to lay him down in the pack and play, he woke up and started crying again. 30 minutes. 30 minutes I let him cry to see if he would put himself to sleep and then I couldn't take it any longer (and the sitter's own daughter was trying to take her nap). So I picked him up and held him back to sleep. 

I know I'm not doing him, or the sitter, any favors by coming to the rescue every time. But at the same time, if he's not eating, I don't know what else to do. I know he needs to learn to function without me there, but it just doesn't sent to be happening. What can I do at home to help him adjust? I feel so overwhelmed. Do I need to schedule time between classes I come back and feed him every day? Or do I stay away longer so that he has no choice but to eat and sleep without me? Help!",6
"A little background:
My son is 13, diagnosed with ADHD, PDD and Asperger's. He is on medication for ADHD. 
I am at my limits and I don't know what to do. His grades are D's and F's (except for gym). He has already ruined almost all school supplies (breaking off erasers off pencils, dismantling pens, ripped apart folders, etc...) - can't afford to replace school supplies all the time.
He doesn't understand discipline as I have grounded him from all outside/inside activity and needs to be reminded daily that he is grounded. And all he has now in his bedroom is a bed and dresser. 
He lies incessantly - even small things that don't matter to me. For example, I found the ice cream left out on counter and asked him to put it away - his response to me was I didn't leave it out"" - even though it was only him and I at home and I don't eat ice cream. I have no trust in him whatsoever. I can't believe anything that comes out of his mouth. Anything.I know he is a teenager and is normal for his age to ""act cool"" around kids at school - but everyday for the last week he has gotten detentions ranging from 'disturbance of others in classroom' to 'throwing objects in classroom'. He has now escalated to getting detentions for fighting. He says he is just protecting his friends. Well I talked to the principal and he said my son was alone in the fight just to fight. Another lie of his. I don't know what to do...yelling doesn't work smacking the mouth when lying doesn't work

"A scenario that repeats itself a couple times a week:
We have kids from two different neighbors visiting our kids. It's about 6pm and we sit down for dinner. The neighbor kids keep playing, but while we eat, some of them complain about being hungry. Their families don't eat dinner until 8pm or later. 
**If these were your kids would you want us to send them home, invite them to dinner, or just keep eating in front of them?**   
A little background:  
When we first moved into the neighborhood we'd invite them to have dinner. 
(Sometimes this made dinner difficult to plan. For example tonight my wife made a crock pot dinner. That means she made the food 4 hours earlier and we really don't have enough food to feed everyone.) 
They started inviting themselves over for dinner more often. At first we'd make them call their parents to ask for permission. Most times the parents would tell them noI'm not upset I just want to know what the right thing to do is. It feels rude to eat in front of people complaining about being hungry. But I know their parents are planning on feeding them at some point. """,2

"Alright ladies, this is going to be a doozy. Thanks in advance to those who are able to get through it. Here's the situation: I am 24 weeks pregnant, due mid/late October. I have a 3 year old at home who I have never spent a night away from. My husband's cousin is getting married late November in PR. We live stateside. My husband is planning on taking my 3 year old and flying to PR for a few days and leaving me alone with our one month old. My perspective: The more I think about the situation, the more I feel like he shouldn't go and he should stay with me and our new baby. My daughter cries when she thinks about the trip because she knows I won't be going with her. When I had my daughter I was so emotional and miserable the first few months postpartum and I'm sure this time will be no different. I don't want to miss out on the trip. I don't want my daughter to be away from me. I don't want to be alone with a one month old. Additionally, there has been talk of my daughter being a flower girl at the wedding though we have yet to be directly contacted by anyone or even receive an invitation/save the date. I am going to be hysterical if I miss seeing that! Of course there are a few more details that complicate the situation. My husband's elderly grandparents live in PR. They have never met my daughter and they are dying to see her in person. I think this is the driving force behind my husband's insistence on going. I have suggested we wait until the new baby is older and all go as a family but he brushed me off. Second, we are in the process of buying a house. The tickets alone are going to cost $1000+ for a ~3-4 day trip. We don't have that kind of money lying around. Third, my daughter has severe food allergies. The relatives in PR don't understand the severity and I'm afraid they will slip her food. I can't even deal with the thought of her having a reaction and me being an plane ride away. My husband is vigilant of course, but we have been in situations where you turn away for a second and someone is offering her potentially deadly food items. And what about the food at the wedding? I am hormonal and getting more and more angry with the situation. I am afraid that my emotions may be skewing my perspective of the situation at hand. What would you do in my situation? What would you expect your husband to do? Thanks again.†",6
"Alright, So this is going to be long winded, I'll warn you now but there is SO much I need to put out on the table and 1) get off my chest, and 2) get help with (hopefully). 
A good friend of mine had suggested I ask for Reddit's help about a month ago and while at the time I was asking just personal family and friends it's gotten to a point where I don't know what to do. 
,So let's go over the current life situation. I had my daughter when I was 16 and had her full time by myself until I she was 2, then she moved in with my mom so I could go to College. About 6 months into school my grandmother died, and my alcoholic grandfather moved to the city we currently live in, so instead of him being alone I moved here to try and make a life for my daughter and I. I got into some personal trouble due to depression and being away from my daughter (though we were in contact as much as possible long distance, and i went to see her for birthdays and Christmases and what not. Whenever I could), I got trapped here for a bit but all of that is settled and things are okay now. My daughter moved back in with me last September, Things were okay to start with, but because it had been so long since I was Mom I became more like a friend. about 5 months ago my current boyfriend and I started seeing each other, and I ended up getting pregnant. He has moved in now as we try to assemble this into a family. 
My Daughter is 6, well 7 in just a couple weeks (2.5 to be exact). Her father is out of the picture, all she knows is that he died when she was 1, what actually happened was he committed suicide (my explanation was that he was really sick and made the pain go away, when she asked how he died. I think I said it a bit more softly than that, but you get the picture) 
So about 3-4 months ago shit hit the fan. It started with fighting. hours and hours of constant fighting with her to clean up after herself, bring her laundry downstairs, brush her teeth, anything and everything was an argument and a huge fight. She would hit me and push me. And then after fighting for an hour she would cry to me and say hug."" and put out her arms and look like this little pissed off ball of rage. I would tell her that how she had treated me was not way to get a hug and that you have to treat others how you want to be treated The fighting continued between her myself I always kept a jar of Jelly Beans on top of the fridge for rewards and sweet treats and about 2 months ago she asked for a few and i said yes I'll spare you some details but as the months have gone on I'll tell you the incidents of her thievery. -Half of one of those giant bags of tootsie rolls/pops for halloween (found the half emptied bag in the cupboard and she said she didn't steal  but after a bit she came clean.) -two   of icing (one large one small)
There is more I just can't remember the rest off the top of my head. She is smart she will hide the garbage in a garbage bag we won't see Now she eats well  or leg  etc.) and scream back at her. 2 Seconds later she will cry and tell me she is sorry and try to hug me and i tell her that's no way to treat someone you want to hug then she flips out again and screams she hates me saying I never let her make things better. This is getting long. I'm looking for help  and advice on what to do because it seems no matter what we do we are doing something wrong... More details can be given is needed  some advice would be great though. """,6

I always assumed she was angry at me for taking away her youth. She always had unreasonably high expectations of what i must be but had never held those high expectations to my two half siblings When i walk through the door there is seldom food on the table i'm expected to cook for myself anything i do is immediately downplayed by saying ""It could've been better"". My masculinity was frequently challenged and put down she'd say ""You can't hammer a nail She tries to label herself as a good parent she says that ""She buys me everything"" She does everything in spite of me recently i needed a renewal on a presciripton of contact lenses they make me feel better about my appearance  but she refused to pay saying ill have to pay with my money In regard to my half siblings  my mother has taught one of them to hate me calling me a ""Asshole"" ""Bitch"" ""Cocksucker"" She used to physically beat me  but that stopped when i was about 13   but she has almost driven me to that point  but i'm very aware of the consequences.

"Although this is my first post from this account, i am a long-time redditor and just wanted to post this question from a blank slate perspective. I don't mind if people want to read through my entire post history but today I just wanted some advice just based on information shared here. Basic background - FTM/SAHM with 5 month old baby and I have no child care support other than my SO. Up until recently, I think everything has been going pretty well - bonded extremely well with baby right away, getting a groove our schedule during the day, taking on a part-time job to give me some structured time away from the house......overall things are good. But here's the real issue - my resentment towards my SO has really gone off the charts lately and I just don't know where to go from here. As I said above, we have no family in-state so I really have the baby exclusively with me 90% of the day. My SO has about an hour commute by train each way for work and he usually leaves between 7-8am and gets home between 7-7:30pm. We decided together that I would give up my full-time job when I was pregnant because I traveled so much and really I love being afforded the luxury of staying home with the baby - BUT here's where I'm getting very resentful towards my SO: - despite promising to allow me time for myself, I have not had a single day off since having our baby. with the exclusion of him taking out the trash, I am 100% responsible or everything else at home, meaning daily laundry, cleaning, pet care, everything- my SO does not give me any positive reinforcement on the job I'm doing with the baby, the housework or even acknowledge me as his partner/individual Before anyone asks, I have talked to him on several occasions and here's the different ways I've approached it:- about the housework, I have brought up to him many, many times that I am overwhelmed with it and that I'm not only upset that he has not followed through with offering any assistance but I'm also hurt that he never even acknowledges all that I'm doing. If he's not going to help, he could at least thank me for sacrificing what time I do have when he's home to do the laundry, dishes, cleaning. The first time I brought it up, he stated that I just needed to tell him what to do (which bothers me in itself because he can clearly see the overflowing laundry basket, the dirty floors, etc just like I can) but when I actually asked him if he could do 'X' he has gotten very defensive that I'm ordering him around. Ugh either way (If I ask for help or leave up to him to do something) it's a losing battle. I love being a full-time mom but I don't love being his full-time maid and that's the way I'm feeling now. Each day is the same thing: get up 6am, have the baby all day until 7-7:30pm, SO comes home, make dinner & then chores, bath time, pass out. I simply can't keep up with it but honestly don't know what else I can do here- about personal time. I have not bottle up my feelings about adjusting to the isolation of being a SAHP and that I need some personal time! He says he doesn't have any time either but I remind him of how he updates me on the new book he's been reading during his two hour commute everyday or how he'll either rave/complain about the restaurant choice for lunch. I've explained to him that I don't get any of that....I don't even have family close enough to be my co-workers"" or even to talk to. He usually will either listen and respond in silence (really no response) or he'll counter with dont I enjoy being with my baby and that's not the point - I love my baby but I'm still a person too. I need those mental breaks that he takes for granted. I mean things will get more exciting the older our baby gets but right now every day is LONG with nothing left for me. Even though he has said that when he gets home †I have my own time it just never happens. If I say I'm just going to go for a walk or even drive around for a little bit Boy I'm sorry this is so much longer than I meant it to be but god it feels good just to get it out even if no one reads this or responds. I love our new addition and I love being a mom but I am truly starting to not hate but greatly resent my SO and I want to fix things but just feel like I'm trying to be both players in a two player game. Is there some angle or approach I should try? I think I did mention above that I will be starting a part-time job which will give me some independence but i will still be the full-time caregiver and jus work on the weekends for extra income. I feel like if I don't nip this in the bud now that things will only get worse with the job on top of everything. Is there some other way I can try to get him to realize what in desperately trying to communicate to him without making it come across as me yelling him? I have been approaching him in a calm fashion but I know that's where it's headed soon""",6
"Am I screwing up my son? My son just turned two years old last week. He is a fairly picky eater, he loves most fruits and stuff, but he is very timid to try new things and eat what we cook. He seems to be a snacker instead of a mealer, if that makes sense.
Anyways, to get to the point, lately when he refuses to eat an item (last night it was fried rice) I tell him that, He better not eat that rice."" This usually gets him to eat it in defiance of my request. Will this create a long term problem? My wife and I are a bit worried that we are actually encouraging him to defy us since there is no punishment or consequence once he does ""break our rule"". To me I think we are just playing the game that is his phase of needing to be in control. To be clear there is a big difference between our tone and demeanor when we are asking him to not eat that rice and telling him to not touch that hot pan. We also do follow through with any promises or consequences we make him aware of before hand.""",1

The person that you are becoming is so much better than the person that I am, and that is all that I have ever hoped or desired for you.
I have made choices throughout your life, many of which I have made you a part, some of which you have not been aware.  Regarding some of these latter decisions, I believe you deserve an explanation, if not a justification. Things are always difficult when you are a parent, and I hope that you will understand this someday; perhaps you will have a better insight than I have had.
My relationship with my father was, and remains complex; I suspect that this is nearly universal truth. Men model relationship based on the father-son dynamic, yet most men I know have difficult relationships with their fathers. It is an unfortunate paradigm of our American society, and one worth changing; if you figure out a way to do that with your son, please do. I hope fervently that I have made some progress towards that goal with you.
You were the best thing to come out of the relationship that your mother and I shared. Nothing else in that relationship dynamic worked. That is not a bitter assessment as much as an honest one; I was not invested in the relationship any more than she was. I have no blame to give anymore ‚Äì there is plenty of responsibility to share. I hope that you understand that I am not angry at her, and if there ever was any anger, it was at the situation more than at any person involved. It is a difficult thing for a man to realize that he was hasty in making the most important choices of his life, and that innocents ‚Äì you ‚Äì will pay the cost for his selfishness. I have tried, with varying degrees of success, to keep my frustration at my failures from spilling out onto inappropriate targets.
You may have noticed ‚Äì though if you have noticed, I have been less than completely successful ‚Äì that I strive to never speak negatively of your mother in your presence. This is a conscious decision that I made early on after the divorce; no matter what had occurred or would occur between your mother and I, you were not a party to it, nor did you need to be a witness to it any more than was unavoidable.
Immediately after the divorce, I told my attorney, and subsequently the family court judge, that you needed to live with your mother and your sisters, although I insisted that I have as much time with you as I could.  The idea of ‚Äúshared parental responsibility‚Äù would be laughable if it were not so tragic, but we tried the best we could in those early years; making sure that the rules were consistent between both houses, trying to balance time spent, though I did not spend anywhere near as much time with you as either of us would have liked, and making the effort to keep communication lines open, though I often felt that it was one-sided. Again, I suspect that this is universal and not limited to men; the non-custodial parent will always feel left out of the loop, always feel last to know, and always feel like they are not getting all the messages. Knowing this doesn‚Äôt help, however.
You and your mother moved around several times, during those years and I didn‚Äôt often know where you were, or who you were living with, which was frustrating. You started school and I didn‚Äôt get pictures, you took your first steps and I didn‚Äôt have video, you started talking and I wasn‚Äôt there. I missed a lot of your firsts, or got them second; but I still was a part of your early life, and I am grateful for that. We watched Disney movies together, we went to the beach, you hugged me goodbye on the mornings that you stayed with me and I had to go to work. I packed your lunches and took you to pre-school, I hung your pictures up all over the house. I still have those pictures. All of them.
The night came that your sister called me at work because you and your sisters were in crisis; the lights and air conditioning were off, there was no food in the house, your mom was not there, and there was yelling and screaming going on.  I don‚Äôt know how much you remember of that night, or how much you were told; I am not laying blame for any of it. I simply realized at that moment that I needed to make a decision as to which environment was better for you.
The circumstances that were extant at the time of the divorce were changed, and after a lot of discussion and hard thought, I realized that the stable, consistent, and more appropriate environment was at my house, and not at your mother‚Äôs. This was not a vindictive decision, not meant to cause pain, not personal in any way. The decision had nothing to do with anyone‚Äôs benefit or detriment but yours. I spoke to your mother, and I spoke to our attorney, and your mother‚Äôs statement was ‚ÄúI am not going to fight you on this, I cannot.‚Äù
Since that time, I‚Äôve tried to give you a stable and reliable home. You‚Äôve never gotten everything you‚Äôve wanted, but you‚Äôve gotten everything you‚Äôve needed; and I‚Äôd like to think a fair amount of the things you‚Äôve asked for. I know that I‚Äôve been strict at times, and I won‚Äôt ever apologize for that. I am proud of your manners, your kindness, your self-discipline, and your awareness of responsibility ‚Äì and while I cannot take all the credit for that, I do believe that children who come from homes that are not taught limits do not learn these quite as well. I am equally proud of your self-confidence, and I take some pride in that, since it proves that I was correct in leaving the wooden spoon and the belt as part of my childhood‚Äôs past.
I have hopes for you, my son.  I hope that you continue to be the man you are becoming; the kind of man who earns Eagle Scout, but has the integrity to work to change the organization from the inside.  The kind of man who stands up for what he believes even when his friends look at him sideways for saying it, and even when adults question him about it.  The kind of man who isn‚Äôt afraid to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù when he doesn‚Äôt, rather than bull it through.  Someone who isn‚Äôt afraid to love unwisely, no matter who, no matter what. A leader by example, not by commands or by superficialities. Someone who is willing to explore matters of faith and belief, and examine them critically, question them, and reject or accept them as he chooses.
And remember, no matter what else, your father loves you, and is damned proud of you.
Love, Dad
EDIT: TL;DR - Wrote a letter to my son to give him when he goes off to college explaining all the things I never said to him while he was growing up about my relationship with his mom. Also reminded him how proud I am of him and the man I see him becoming.",6
"And I feel like I am losing. My daughter is turning 2 next month and has always been on the small side. At her last appointment the pediatrician was not worried and just thought she was going to be on the petite side. However she did want me to encourage calorie heavy foods and whole milk. She loves milk and I think 30% of her calories come from it but I feel like it is too much and she needs to be eating more solid foods. I make breakfast, lunch, and dinner (snacks in between) and she will just pick and eat a couple pieces then she wants to get down out of her chair or crawl on the table or play with crayons. This results in her father and I giving her little bits of food as she plays (this needs to change). She is just so active and gets easily distracted. She has a great amount of energy but it breaks my heart when I can see her ribs because of how thin she is. Has anyone else been through this? Any advice? I'm going to set up a doctors appointment within the next month.",2
"And I proceed to tell a story in which Harvey the train has a problem with whatever it is (reality need not apply!)  and he tries three things - one crazy thing Today Son told us a story. Not a Harvey story. Instead but I'm not going to nitpick :) )

"Any advice would be appreciated. My son started teething at 4 months and by the time he was 5 months old, he had his first 4 teeth. During that time, he was drooling more and starting to spit up a lot (he didn't spit up much at all as an infant). Now, he's 6.5 months old and eating ~2 meals of fruits/veggies and cereal plus ~4 6oz bottles a day and no matter what or when he eats, he spits up anywhere between 30 minutes and 3 hours later...and it stinks so bad. 
Basically, he is an unpredictable spout of barf dribble. It's usually just a tablespoon or so and he doesn't seem bothered by it, but I'm losing my mind changing his clothes 4-5 times a day, washing his high chair cushion, carseat lining, floor blankets, my clothes and hair, throw rugs, couch cushion, etc. I've tried keeping a bib on him, but he's almost crawling and he loves rolling around and sitting up on the floor, so the bib does pretty much nothing. 

I've tried cutting out solids entirely and going back to formula, but that didn't make any difference. I've tried feeding him less (4oz bottles instead of 6). I'm in-between pediatricians right now (he has his 6mo well visit next week), so since this isn't an emergency, I really don't have anyone to call.
He has started drooling a lot more lately, but he seems way too young to be getting more teeth (like I said, he already has his 2 top and 2 bottom). Oh, and he is peeing/pooping normally and is getting enough food and drink to stay down. He is a happy baby with no other signs that would indicate illness. He's never even had diaper rash. Oh, and one other thing. 
He never ever spits up in his crib. Strangely, his crib bedding smells just fine and he naps there 2x a day and sleeps there all night. One more thing that might have something to do with this, when the spitting up started is when he stopped sleeping through the night. He used to go down at 9pm and wake at 7am. Now he wakes at least twice a night, drinks 2-3 ounces, then falls back to sleep. 
Any thoughts? Suggestions? Similar stories? Please someone tell me this vomit stench will go away, or at lease ease up a little bit.",6
"Any one had any success using meat baby foods in recipes such as chicken nuggets or sticks or anything? I've got tons of left over baby food jars and babes does NOT want anything pureeed, only things she can feed herself. I haven't found any meat recipes online and every idea I've tried resulted in weirdness. I tried mixing with baby cereal and making sticks and baking and the outside got chewy but the inside didn't cook. Added egg and tried again, same thing. Fried as pancakes and same thing. We've got the veggie and fruits taken care of ( We use them in smoothies or with oatmeal or in pancakes, or add into appropriate recipes for adults) but we've so many meats! Seems like you should be able to make a chicken nugget or something!",2
"Any time I go places with my 3 year old, he has a very hard time. He really likes being hands on about stuff and is a bit of a wild child. We are constantly trying to work with him on socializing (Ask before you grab"" Funny thing is  the kids at the playgrounds are usually much more tolerant of rougher play But anyways... how can you go about socializing a rough and tumble kid?""",6
"Any way to deal with this other than waiting it out and telling him to stop? We have been over this so much I am sure he has heard enough from us. If it isn't his shirt it is something in his hand, or his hand in the mouth. We keep telling him we will throw out things if he puts them in his mouth, and only food and juice go in his mouth. He knows he is screwing up, when I see him walking with a pencil or something I will say Maaaaace?""

Thanks for the great replies yeah I agree I am not screaming at him bow to your sensei or anything",6
Anyone else have a husband that deals with depression? It's definitely brought on by stress and having three kids under 4 is ALWAYS stressful! He's done therapy before and even tried medicine but he's not really willing to make the commitment he needs to. I've already threatened to leave but with three little kids I don't really want that. How can I motivate him to exercise and eat better as well as go back to therapy so that we can have a happy marriage back? ,6

Anyone have experience with tooth decay? I don't know if I gave my baby a high sugar diet but her teeth began to turn a little yellow I'll be honest i didn't brush her teeth regularly and at 15 months old she cries bloody murder. So she was playing and chipped a tooth about a week ago I've been very hard on myself feeling like a bad mom. Now today we went out she tripped and fell hurting her lip with her chipped tooth and chipping her other front tooth!!! I was a mess beating myself up. She has a doctors appointment on Wednesday but I can't help but look at her and feel like such a bad mom. Is there anything a dentist could do? Oh and I'm still breastfeeding and it's hurting so bad I just don't want to have her been sedated to get anything done but I feel vain also not having her perfect little teeth and being broken ,6
"Apologies in advance for the length of this, but I think backstory and examples are necessary here. 
My son just turned three. He is extremely intelligent. The psychiatrist we've been seeing for his issues suggested development testing and he scored highly gifted. He may be a smart boy, but he also has the worst behavior of any three-year-old child I have ever seen.
Some backstory. He has been a difficult child since birth. He was up 5-6 times per night until he was 14 months old. At the age of 3, he still doesn‚Äôt sleep through the night most nights. He also had colic, and screamed close to 8 hours a day for months on end. He is sick all the time. He will go maybe a week without cold symptoms and then be sick for months on end (we‚Äôve investigated allergies but he has tested negative for everything so far). He also has gastrointestinal problems. He‚Äôs had borderline diarrhea since starting on solid food (we‚Äôve tried various elimination diets but nothing has made a difference). He also has never been able to play happily on his own, always requiring someone to be with him, entertaining him. On a great day, he‚Äôll play on his own happily for five minutes. Tops. 
He has an incredible impulse control problem. He is violent with me, his father, and the other kids at his daycare. The violence is very typically unprovoked. For example, last week he got out of his cot during nap at daycare, picked up a shoe and hit another sleeping child in the head. According to the staff, she and my son hadn't even played together that day.  He will walk up to me while I‚Äôm cooking dinner and hit me with his toys. When I react in pain, he often laughs.
He has no attention span. He cannot even maintain eye contact with you when you are trying to talk to him, always looking around for other things he can focus on. He has no patience and no fuse. If something doesn‚Äôt go his way, he erupts in anger immediately, screaming, crying, throwing things, or hitting whoever happens to be nearby.  
He is also hyperactive. He never walks anywhere, even in the house. He runs and jumps. He cannot sit still for more than 10 seconds (unless we are reading to him). And he never shuts his mouth. He literally must be talking ever second of every day. We never get a break.
He is also not yet potty trained. He knows how to use the potty, but chooses not to. He'd rather go in his pull-ups, and then laughs when we have to change them. We have tried putting him in underwear, but he pees and poops in that too. 
Everyday when I pick him up from daycare, I get the ‚Äúdamage report‚Äù: how many other children he hurt, how many naps he disrupted etc. Between the potty training, the refusal to nap and the violent behavior with other children, the daycare is threatening to kick him out. And I can‚Äôt blame them. I‚Äôd kick him out too.
I want to be clear: I do not have unrealistic expectations for my child. He's three. I expect a certain amount of violence, tantrums, impulse control problems, hyperactivity etc. My issue is that he is off the chart on all these things when compared to his peers. And we have tried EVERYTHING to improve his behavior: rewards, praise, negative reinforcement, punishment (i.e. taking toys away), timeouts, counting‚Ä¶ everything. We have done exhaustive investigations of his health issues, spanning allergy testing, dietary changes, family doctors, specialists, psychiatrists, counselors‚Ä¶ nothing has helped.
Bottom line is, because of all these issues, I have never felt attachment to this child, and grow more distant from him after every battle, every violent outburst. My resentment for him grows. I resent him because we always wanted to have two kids, but there is no way we will have a second one after him. I resent him because he has therefore robbed me of my opportunity to parent a normal, loving child.  I resent him because he loves his father more than he loves me, even when he is the disciplinarian and I am not.  I resent him because I go to bed each and every day exhausted, angry and broken, on the verge of an anxiety attack.  I resent him because instead of enjoying time playing with my child, I dread it because I know it will only end in one of us screaming, and me with some kind of physical injury.
So, r/mommit‚Ä¶ where do I go from here? I am desperate. I have tried parental counseling, as well as child psychiatry with no help.  We cannot ask for more childcare from my family, and cannot afford to hire outside babysitting right now.  I need to get these feelings of distance and resentment under control, so that I can be a better parent. I need to fix his behaviours so that I don‚Äôt have a mental breakdown. 
Thanks to everyone who made it through this monster post. I‚Äôll take any and all advice/criticism/suggestion.",6
"Apple Party - a fun way to celebrate fall with kids. Recommended for ages 8 and up, but if you have younger kids some of the steps can be modified to be more fun for them. For an added fun activity, you can have your kids hand make the invitations to the Apple Party. Many stores like Dollar Tree sell supplies for teachers that might include pieces of paper or stickers in the shape of apples.
1. Go to the market and buy at least two of each type of apple. The more different types, the better. Make sure they are labeled so you know what the different types are called.
2. Make an index card for each type of apple with its name, color, sweet or sour, where it was grown, what its primary use is, and any other fun facts you can think of.
3. Use cups or mugs (one for each type of apple). Label them with numbers and keep a list so you know which type of apple goes to which mug. Put sliced apples in the appropriate mugs and set them out on the table. If you bought 1 of each type, slice one to put in the mug and keep the other one whole for later.
4. Depending on how many kids you have, split them into groups of 2 or 3. Give each group a notebook to write with, or if kids are too young to write well just use a large dry erase board that they can all see and you do the writing.
5. Go through the mugs one at a time and have each group spend some time with the slices. Have them answer questions about it. If kids are younger, keep it simple, like ‚ÄúWhat color is the skin?‚Äù ‚ÄúDoes it taste sweet or sour?‚Äù For older kids you can ask ‚ÄúIs this one better for eating raw or cooking?‚Äù ‚ÄúWould you recommend this type to a friend?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you got to name this apple, what would you call it?‚Äù Get each group‚Äôs responses. It is your choice which ‚Äúthinking questions‚Äù to ask - sometimes it‚Äôs nice to have opinion questions with no right answer, and sometimes it‚Äôs nice to have some trivia questions where the answers appear on the index cards.
6. Get the kids to leave the room and put the whole apples on the table with their index cards. Make sure you put the corresponding numbers with them so the kids can compare.
7. If possible, give prizes. Depending on the group, you can reward the most accurate answers, the most creative made-up apple name, etc.Variations:
This can be done with any food, or multiple types of food. If you are feeling super creative, you can do this with different types of fruits and vegetables. Leave them whole for younger children and they can learn about the different types. For older children, you can blend each vegetable and add food coloring to disguise them, then have the kids analyse the taste. Using posters or props with lots of color can help keep kids interested!",3
"As a breastfeeding mother, My son hates being covered while feeding, like, he won't even let me cover his legs with a blanket while laying down for bed. he doesn't even like it when I cover myself up. like he seriously despises any kind of cover up. If they had to deal with the kicking and biting I bet people wouldn't feel so negative about it. That being said, we rarely feed in public any more. He tries to uncover my other breast too much for me to feel comfortable. My son is about to be 2 and I keep being told that I should have stopped breastfeeding him at 1. That at this point it's just weird, thoughts? I am in a group on Facebook and a lady in the group said she had breastfed one of her children until she was five (Outside the US, I believe she said it was part of the culture there and wanted to know what the experience was like.) As a single mom with no time to myself I know I couldn't feed him until he was 5 but I am starting to feel like there is no end in sight. He enjoys feeding too much. I wouldn't even know where to start with weening.†",6

"As I write this, I'm sitting in the dark, watching my sweet baby screaming his sweet little head off in his swing. He's nearly 5 months, and his sleep has fallen apart COMPLETELY. I knew a sleep regression was coming, but this is worse than I ever imagined.
He used to nap pretty well... approx. 3 naps a day, varying from 1.5 hours to 3 hours! And he was down to one wake-up a night. Looking back, it was glorious. Then, about a month ago, he started taking 5-6 naps a day at only 45 minutes each, and waking up 3-5 times a night. Over the weekend, he decided to start skipping entire naps and I can see in his face that he's EXHAUSTED.
We help him in every way we can... he sleeps in his crib, in his cool, dark room. He's always swaddled (sometimes double-swaddled when he's really fighting sleep), always has a pacifier. We always play loud white noise (radio static), and we always follow our naptime routine (diaper change, swaddle, short story in rocking chair, rock and shush until drowsy, lie down for nap). I always avoid eye-contact when he's super-sleepy, and only say it's naptime"" during this process.I've tried everything I can think of and have read every infant sleep article I can find. I'm not comfortable using CIO until 6 months and it hasn't helped in the least. I tried unswaddling him but he scratches his face like crazy and gets totally wound up. I tried taking him to the doctor thinking he had an ear infection but he didn't. And I would try to drive him around but we only have one car and baby daddy works full-time.
FWIW he's exclusively breastfed he also has eczema (currently under control) and we're looking into food allergies. I'm going to talk to his doc on Wed. about potentially trying an elimination diet (although I really really  really really don't want to cut out everything I love - dairy eggs wheat etc.).Overall I feel really helpless. He just WON'T SLEEP. I know he needs it. I know he's tired. He just won't do it. It's this awful but that is my only means of survival. Someone please help us before I lose my mind!""",6

"As someone who could be having kids in the very near future, I'm very curious about this sensation. I've heard of so many moms who are in tears trying to breast feed even though they can't, and become wracked with guilt when they switch to formula, for example. Personally I have no interest in breastfeeding at all. The idea of having a baby painfully suck on my breast several times a day does not appeal to me at all. However, I do think it has something to do with the fact that my mom didn't breast feed me. I was a formula baby (And very healthy, smart, and don't have attachment issues thank you very much) and I think people mimic what they know sometimes. What about you, Moms of reddit? What is it about breastfeeding that makes women so fired up?",6
"As you can guess we are new parents and I don't know if we are doing something wrong. 
What's going on is that our baby gets asleep while being breast feeded after a few minutes then she wakes up about half an hour later crying and moving her lips like if she was looking for more milk, so wife feeds her again and the baby gets asleep once more.
Wife felt so frustrated last night so I prepared a bottle of formula and feed the baby, she didn't finished the whole bottle (1.5 oz) but she slept for a couple hours this time. Wife says that during the day this is no issue. Any ideas about whats happening?

"Background information: I recently entered a relationship with a girl I've known a long time. She has a 4 year old son who we'll call Gordon for the sake of this post. Gordon's father is non-existent. He hasn't seen Gordon since he was first born and as such Gordon has grown up fatherless. My girlfriend was a single mother for those first 3 1/2 years, working a full time job and going to school, so she was living with her parents at the time. We've been living together about 7 months now though.
As stated before, Gordon grew up with his mother, grandmother, and grandfather always around. His grandparents coddled him a lot, and were generally against discipline. Not against I guess, but they would give 3-5 warnings, and then give him a timeout, in which they always would let up early on. My girlfiend (we'll call her Kayla) was under huge amounts of stress with her job, bills, and schoolwork at the time, and when she got home she would be completely exhausted, and would cause her to avoid standoffs with Gordon about bedtime or rule breaking.
Now I've never had a child so I'm new to this whole thing. I love Gordon unequivocally, but he thinks he can still get away with things that he used to. Examples I guess would include throwing wood chips (or sand) on the playground at other kids, he once sucker punched a kid at school, headbutt a kid, when we go out to eat he refuses to eat or picks at his food until we are done eating, and when we are ready to leave he throws a tantrum because he's not done (even if we're there an hour). Because his grandparents were lax in there discipline, Kayla has kind of become complacent with it as well. This means I'm usually the one to discipline him. I'm the one to scold him. I'm the one to send him to his room. I'm the one to take his toys away. And while I'm not against spanking, I've never nor would I ever spank him because he's not MY child and it would just feel wrong. We don't subject him to obscene amounts of violence. I say obscene because he's 4, and he loves spiderman, batman, ironman, etc etc etc so he's seen the movies. He watches the old spiderman cartoons on the kindle all the time.
I bring this all up because first off, he got in trouble for hitting one of his teachers today. He went to bed fine, with promises of ice cream tonight (before the incident) because he was so good yesterday, so he wasn't in a bad mood or anything. And secondly, I feel as if he's going to grow up hating me because I'm the one scolding him the majority of the time. 
What can we do to help curb his recent hitting problem?
What can I do to not have him hate me?",1
"Background: My son is almost 8 months old. He is my first child. His father and I are married almost 4 years. There are some problems in the marriage. I have Post Partum Depression and Anxiety Disorder (but I had Depression and Anxiety pre-pregnancy). My son is breastfed and started solid food around 5.5-6 months. The first 5 months, after 4-5 different types of sleeping arrangement trial-and-errors, Derek slept in a co-sleeper attached to our bed. It's called an Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper -- and it's really just a Pack-and-Play that attaches securely to the bed. At five months, I was no longer sleeping well and neither was he, so we made the transfer to his crib. Up until then he was a terrible napper, but a decent sleeper at night. Sure, there were night wakings and sometimes many, but usually a feed was enough to put him right back to sleep. Since he went into the crib, he has been a regular napper with few problems for napping -- putting himself on a very regular schedule. Recently he dropped from 3 naps (on a 2 hour nap, 2 hour awake schedule 3 times per day) to 2 naps (on a 2 hour nap, 3 hour awake schedule). For several weeks now, though, he gets up multiple times in the night and won't go back to sleep. He won't play quietly anymore. Our routine is as follows: * Diaper change and lotion massage following dinner, evening play, †and bath (if it is bath night -- has eczema, we bathe sparingly). We have started to do his cereal at night instead of breakfast. * Vitamin D Drops and Infant Advil for teething (working on front top two teeth). Brush teeth (two lower). * Evening breastfeed. * White noise machine and sleep sheep, flannel sheet, two favorite blankies, bunny lovey, night light. * Prefers stomach to sleep (this is just how he is, downvote if you must, I'm too tired to argue about it). His schedule: * 8 PM is almost always Bed Time * 10-12 is usually First * 3-5/6 PM is usually Second Nap, I try to make him stay in his crib until 7 AM... but that doesn't always work, especially lately. He usually wakes up for the day between 4 AM and 7 AM. It's a gamble. Messing with the bed time doesn't seem to help anything. I am baby-led; I follow his sleepy cues for his nap times and bed time. Things we have tried: * Have tried vaporizer but it doesn't seem to help. * Switching cereal to dinner, protein & veggies to lunch, fruit & yogurt to breakfast in case it is silent reflux. Waiting on family doctor to return from vacation to get him into her in case this might be the issue? * Have tried the pause"" -- not a real *cry* but letting him fuss a bit before going to him in the night. He does not self settle anymore. * Have tried feeding him every time even if he's not hungry. Sometimes he will go back to sleep. Often he will not. * He refuses pacifiers and has since he was a newborn. * I have tried to let him ""cry it out"" a little. I can only stand it for a short period of time (5-10 minutes). If his cries sound distressed †I will not allow him to cry anymore. Please don't suggest that I allow more than that. My heart cannot take it. My anxiety cannot take it. It doesn't work anyway. * I have tried going in and shush-patting him. He gets more distressed. * I have tried pick-up/put-down. He gets more distressed when I place him back in the crib. * I try laying next to him on the floor. He is more distressed by this than if I weren't there at all. * I lay in the hallway in front of his door. (crying myself). It makes no difference. * I try rocking him. He arches his back away from me and screams. He hasn't liked being rocked to sleep since he was a newborn. I have been hospitalized at the crisis unit for sleep deprivation once already. I do not know what else to do. I'm miserable. I'm depressed. I don't expect him to sleep through the night at all. I just want him to go back to sleep after waking up to feed and not stay up 2-4 hours. That's all. I feel like I'm beginning to fall apart at the seams. Could this be silent reflux †or am I just being hopeful that it's a problem that has a possible definitive solution? I'm afraid to co-sleep again because I already sleep very poorly and never did well with him *in my bed with me*. The Arm's Reach was a bassinet style model and my son is getting too mobile for that to be a safe option. Also I'm afraid it would undo all the familiarizing I've done to make him comfortable with his crib -- he does fine with his naps. Any advice for me?""",6
"Background: My son is large and a very good eater.  He is breastfed, and LOVES the small amount solid food we give him.  As long as he isn't hungry, he has been a great sleeper- but his growth spurts are horrendous. At 5.5 months, he started teething, then hit a growth spurt, and now I have no idea what is going on.  His doctor (who is normally spot-on with her advice) recommended helping him re-learn to sleep after such a long disruption, but so far nothing helped.  He will randomly sleep through the night again (usually just as I start researching sleep training), so I don't bother.  Then as suddenly as it stopped, it starts up again.  In the last 6 weeks, I estimate he has slept normally 8 nights.  In all this time, he is still a pretty poor napper (2 45-min naps a day at daycare typically).  Here are all of the things I have tried:
- More breast milk: as often as he would take it, I gave it- plus a bottle of frozen milk for good measure.  No difference, and he ate less the next day
- More solid food: again, no change- but BOY can my kid eat when you let him!
- Long, hot baths: very wet bathroom, slightly earlier to bed AND awake
- Music/darkness for an hour before bed: this only made me more sleepy.
- Putting him back to sleep without food at night: he just kept waking up in smaller increments until I fed him, no change the next day or night.
- Crying it out: I admit I wasn't fully committed to this one, but it just seems strange to me not to feed a hungry baby- especially one that really only cries when he is hungry.  I tried for 30 minutes on two occasions with no change.
- White-noise from humidifier: no change
- No noise: no change
- Elevated one end of mattress: no change
- Sleeping in favorite swing: no change
- Sleeping in sight of me: no change
- Encouraging long naps by holding him: no change
- Discouraging naps with entertainment and noise: no change
TLDNR: How do you get a 6 month old to sleep at night? Or do you?
Update: IT WAS THE CAFFEINE!!  I started drinking caffeine when he started having trouble sleeping, and apparently that was passing to him through my milk.  Yesterday, I cut out the caffeine, and last night his sleeping improved dramatically.  Also, today he has actually been napping again.  It is possible this is just a temporary improvement, but I am holding out hope that he and I are destined to sleep again in the near future.  
Also, I am aware that caffeine isn't supposed to pass through breast milk in reasonable quantities (which is why I thought it was ok to drink), but anecdotally women swear their children are affected.  In my case, the amount of caffeine probably was not reasonable, and well- I'll believe anything that explains fixes this sleep disruption for us. :-)",6
"Brahmin Cow Parenting"" is what I call it when people used to tell me that I should never show anger or fear to my child. And I think it's a shitty thing to do to a little kid  and the only excuse for it should be botox. Imagine for some terribly stupid reason  you have a toddler and a glass-top coffee table. (OMG  and if it breaks  you could get hurt  so we must be careful not to break it. It's a reasonable request that is going to make little to no sense to a toddler. After all  maybe they saw a glass break once  maybe a mirror  but those things aren't TABLES  and she's seen YOU stand on the dining room table to change a lightbulb. To the toddler mind  you telling her she can't climb on that table is just you being random. Generally accepted parenting theory right now states that when one catches (inevitably) the toddler climbing on the table  one removes her with a firm ""No"". When she goes back The problem is  like so many of us can attest THAT's brahmin cow parenting. It's mean because that little kid  maybe she's annoyed and frustrated too I am not advocating losing your cool. I'm saying that when one is trying to teach a small child about the world and interacting with the people in it  one is doing them a MASSIVE disservice by hiding the fact that other people have emotions and that their actions can result in another person having a negative emotional reaction. I'm saying you don't calmly and quietly explain to junior that we don't hit  and personal consequences.""",6

I gained 7lb months 0-5 pp and then cut out sugar and flour -- and have only lost lost 2 lb in 4 months.

"Dad here, Mom is not on Reddit. My daughter is 5 1/2 weeks old. The hospital where we had her discourages pacifiers, which after our experience with our son (now almost 4) of getting up 5 times a night to re-insert it into his mouth we were fine with.

We are using Gerber silicone nipples on her bottles Currently to get her to sleep (especially at night) we are resorting to putting her in the baby carrier and walking with her or taking her for a drive  as yesterday she was awake for 8 hours straight (4pm to midnight) because everytime she stopped eating she woke up. I've even tried dipping the pacifier in formula before giving it to her   and that hasn't worked.

"Daycare said that bottles are forbidden in the toddler room without a specific dr note to continue them. They said something about DCF rules??  My 13mos old still takes three 5oz bottles of breast milk at daycare along with her three solids and one snack.  She drinks her non-breastmilk fluids from a straw cup without any difficulty. I really don't see a reason to wean her off the bottle because we're still breastfeeding at home.  When did you stop giving your baby bottles?  Versus how long you breastfed?
We've been dealing with some weight gain issues so I'm trying to get her to take in as many calories as possible.  Even on days she's not feeling well, the bottle/breast seem like the most reliable way to get her to eat and I'm nervous about rocking the boat too much. Is there any harm in letting her continue to use bottles just for her breastmilk?
Update:  They are asking for a note not only for bottles, but to justify continuing breastmilk. The letter has to state something like Baby needs to continue receiving breastmilk because she is allergic to cow's milk.""  They say it has something to do with them being on the Florida state food program?!?  I can't believe it takes a dr note for to continue getting my milk instead of a cow's!!!""",6
"Dear /r/parenting..
We're having some issues here.
Let's start with some background: an almost 3yo, VERY stubborn, very DIYS, VERY frustrated due to lack of good communication skills - he's being spoken to in 2 languages, english and polish. He talks 24/7 but made his own language so far from the two mentioned above. That's all fine..    
Issue: we stopped the whole bottle thing. A few days ago. Since then he's not consuming as much liquids as he used to when fed with a bottle (juice, water, milk). He's doing fine with a sippy cup or normal cup but it seems like he's just too lazy to drink as much as he used to.
Issue #2: I've read some posts here about kids who don't wanna eat. He used to eat veggies, baby foods, yoghurt, deli meat, chicken.. Basically one day, a long time ago, he protested and stopped. It happened one day and stayed like this although we were and are approaching him in many ways to get him to eat normal goods. He screams bloody murder when he sees a spoon with soup approaching. 
All he wants to eat (and here comes the standard): things like cheetos, pretzels, sometimes bread, tortillas, sweets etc. 
We stopped giving him any sweets apart from a tiny teaspoon of nutella /w PB.     
How the hell can we get a 3yo to eat normal food. I know he can, because he used to. 
I know it's a process. Could you share some insight? Telling him funny food-stories and playing games is all fine but he does not get them due to the language barrier. I know he understands more than he's pretending to ;) So words work whenever he wants them to work.    
The problem as well is that I'm the one working, my husband raising him for now and he gave up. Basically all he says is he's gonna start eating when he's ready"" (insert: use a potty I've got weekends and evenings to enforce healthy food habits.

"Disclaimer:  I've had an insanely stressful week and just finished having my baby scream at me for 45 minutes so please leave ALL preaching at the door.  I'm asking for advice/experience/opinions on my situation and nothing else.
My daughter turned 5 months on the 9th.  My SO and I decided I would breast feed exclusively for 5 months and we'd have her on a bottle and formula by 6 months, giving us a one month transition period.  For the first week we had my SO feed her formula for her night-time meal and it seemed to be going great.  My breast adjusted quickly to skipping one feeding.  I would offer her a bottle now and again during the day if I wasn't feeling particularly full or hydrated, sometimes she'd take it, other times she wouldn't.
On Tuesday she got some shots (a topic I'm NOT looking for advice on.) and since then the bottle has sent her into absolute fits of fury.  For the last two nights my SO has tried to get her to take her bottle and she's just cried herself to sleep.  I just tried to insist on her taking the bottle with the same results.  I'm worried about her getting enough nutrients, but I'm seriously hell bent on being done breastfeeding by the 9th of April, plus, with us skipping one feeding each night for a week, I'm concerned about still making enough for her since she tends to fall asleep at the breast.
So, any advice, ideas on how to shift her over to formula?  With our son it was more of a cold turkey kind of thing and at only 6 weeks, for many different reasons that aren't important here.  I want her to start taking more and more formula meals, but I don't want her starving.  She's already in the 3% tile for weight and 7% for height, she's a petite little thing and I have to admit it's starting to freak me out.  Anything helpful, I'd love to her it, thank you.

"Disclaimer: **IN NO WAY DO I FEEL THAT HER SON IS MALNURSHIED OR IN HARMS WAY, I DO NOT WORRY ABOUT HIS WELL BEING OR THAT SHE IS BEING AN UNFIT PARENT.**

ok, a friend of mine is a single mom and has a son who just turned 1 1/2, my son is 1 so its not like I don't know what I think I am doing. Her son has no mental or physical disabilites and is much larger than mine.  I don't judge her at all or thing she is a bad parent in anyway I just think she is being a little over protective. 
when I visit her house she has no toys that are for any age over 4-6 months except for a walker, now she is not on the low end of the poverty level I know for a fact that money is not an object. she still bottle feeds him formula(no hating) but she dosen't let himself feed, she craddles and coddles him and hold his bottle for him no matter how much he fights its and when he eats solids she never lets him self feed there either. she rarely lets him get outside to play especailly with other kids and acts as though he is a tiny baby instead of a toddler. when they come over here to hang out(rare chance) she brings her own toys and asks that they don't play with my sons toys becasue she feels that they are to old for him. I have tried several times to talk her into letting him grow up but she just gets defensive and tells me that he is her baby and she needs to protect him, she just dosen't want him getting hurt. once when she had to get a babysitter I watched him for her for a few hours and let them play with my sons toys(bad I know, I should have respected her wishes but I could not help it they were so fussy and fed up with the infant treatment) I had never seen her son so happy to play with big boy"" toys.

Why is my happy boy having such difficulties in his sleep? It's draining me (not sleeping through the night for 17 months now) but mostly worrying.  ",6
"Edit: Now that I think about it, the title should have been Question for breastfeeders and their mates"" 
There's another post in which a husband got very protective of his wife when she was asked to cover up in a store while nursing her infant. I also breastfed my son  but couldn't imagine walking around the store ""tits out"" as it were. (Yes Many have written how disrespectful it was to even dare ask the mother to cover up when it is ""her right to feed her child whenever she likes.""

I need advice. And this isn't as simple as the answers I am sure I will get, as I have tried a ton of different things. 
My son sneaks out of his room at night. Seems like a simple thing right? It isn't.... He gets up to play on the computer. We have a very strict you can't push any thing on the computer"" policy because of all the horrible things that are online. So he started getting up at about 1 am (we are up till 12 normally or later) and getting online and watching horrific things that I don't even want him repeating to me.Any way. We deleted all the icons. He found a way to get into the browser and SNES emulator through the menu. We turn it off  he learned to turn it on. We turn off the power strip Beyond just trying to turn off things and kill the power my boyfriend and I don't even sleep together any more in order to try and keep this under control. One of us is in the living room on the couch by the computer and one of us is in bed near the tv. We always wake up and punish him for his behavior but he just tries again later apparently what we do isn't enough. This also goes on for five hours a night *regularly*Ö This gets even better folks. The way our house is set up I have a door to the bathroom in my room he has one in his room. We lock our side so he has one less route to get up and mess around. Last night he picked the lock. Yea.. my four year old can pick locks now too. I was going in my room to bed when I found some stuff he pulled out in my washroom.  He is even smart enough to hide out of site from us (we can't see in our washroom from the living room and if he hides right we can't see him in the bedroom either). I am at my wits effing end. after four months of fighting with him for three to five hours a night and being outsmarted on every thing we try I don't know what to do and I am getting angrier and shorter with him for this and every thing because I am so tired and annoyed by the day. Please don't suggest unplugging any thing I know he will plug things back in and that is a safety issue.  Is it inhumane  to make him stand in time out until he falls asleep? I was thinking about trying that on his first escape right after bed time. O did I mention he does this right after bed and then later at night as well? 
TL:DR  My 4 year old gets up at night to play online. I can't sleep with or in the same room as  my boyfriend anymore because we both spend about five hours a night fighting to put him back in bed  for the last 4 months"" ",6

"Ever since our daughter's 10-month birthday, she's gone through a complete personality change. The biggest things I've noticed are: - she's not eating solids AT ALL anymore. She will not eat anything off a spoon. She does know how to self feed, so I tried boiling veggies, cutting up fruits, etc and she still will not eat them. The only things I can get her to eat are those little yogurt bites and puffs. She won't even go in the high chair without having an absolute fit. I read online somewhere that this is normal and that I should let her try to feed herself with the spoon but I tried that too and food went EVERYWHERE. Like there was food in her diaper everywhere. It was bad. - she used to be a very crawl-y, 'put me down so I can play' baby, but now she wants to be held 24/7. If I put her down even for a minute she will scream. She calms down if she gets distracted but once she sees me doing something she starts the crying again. -she never naps and wakes up super early in the morning. We did the Ferber method when she was five months old (I know, I'm a terrible parent and deserve to die a slow painful death and my kids going to do drugs, etc) and it worked perfectly on her but lately she has been going to bed around 10 and waking up at seven. Like I said, she doesn't nap during the day at all except during car rides. What can I do, mommit? Anyone else experienced this? Tldr 10 month old turns into a screaming banshee",6
"Every once in a while I come up with a parenting idea or trick that turns out to work really well.  For instance, my 3 yo son usually finishes dinner before we do, and then constantly bugs us, asking us if we're done so that he can have dessert.  Well, recently I got tired of this, so just on the spot I made a new rule:  he's got to ask us at least five different questions before he can ask us if we're done again, and they have to be a different question each time, no recycling.  This has really pushes him to think about different things to ask about (why did we get a new fence? So what about you?

"Everyone has the need to feel loved and cherished and this is especially true for little ones. They appreciate it when they get a cuddle once in a while. Have you noticed how calm and contained they become after they get a kiss or a hug for good night? This is so because your child wants to feel you. But they also get assured they are being loved and accepted by someone.Ever since your baby was born, he would reach arms to grab either you or the nearby object. This is called an instinct which must be important for the child. The loving parent in return encourages that behavior even more by smiling back or hugging their baby. All this will  feed the child‚Äôs need to know he is looked after and it is already a part of a healthy relationship.
Research shows that children who are hugged more often grow up more secured and resilient. That makes sense because the child needs to know that there is at least one person he can count on. This will inevitably secure stepping on a firm ground that will form an ability in the child to easily work out problems and overcome the obstacles and challenges in life. And this is  probably one of the most important things to keep in mind when rearing your child. What they get is what they will become one day!!!
So the more your child feels the intimacy between the two of you the more he will be able to love the outside world. A world in which one should be intelligent, talented, sociable and significant. That is why hugging and kissing our children is OK. It nurtures the relationship between the dyad as well as it provides more loving environment for the child. And there is nothing wrong with that.

"Fellow parents, I need some advice on napping. 
I have a 3 month old who is sleeping through the night (yay!). From about 7 weeks, she will not nap for any large amount of time during the day. She will fall asleep while being fed a few times throughout the day, but would never sleep for more than about 20 minutes consecutively. 
When she does fall asleep after feeding and I am able to put her down (tried her crib, the couch, swing, play mat, our bed) she will either be wide awake immediately or only rest for a few minutes unless I let her stay on me. When she is placed anywhere to nap but on me, she will melt down as soon as she wakes up. If I let her nap on me, she will nap for 1-2 hours, slightly waking about every 15-20 minutes to feed a bit then fall back asleep. I would really prefer to not have her napping on me so that I am able to have a small break. 
I know three months is a bit early for a set routine but I really need help in moving toward one. She is basically attached to me from when she wakes up until my husband is home from work. I have tried a few carriers, she is not a fan but we are working on getting her more comfortable in them.

I had frequent sciatic pain as well so bad towards the end that my knees would just give out randomly while doing simple tasks like dishes. I never suffered with constipation however or dark patches (I did get some stretch marks) I had that overall glow"" they talk about. This third pregnancy is almost completely opposite.

"First I should start by saying the Pediatrician isn't concerned, but I don't like to blindly accept that they always know what they're talking about so I thought I'd ask here.
My daughter is nine months old and has always been a good eater.  She's in the 25% for weight and 52% for height and extremely active which is why the doctors aren't concerned.  She does eat, but sometimes decides that she doesn't want to eat anymore halfway through a meal.  Meals consist of 1/2 a jar of stage 2 baby food and 2-3T of wheat/rice/mixed grain/oatmeal cereal.  Water is added to smooth it out as needed.  The barfing comes in when she is eating chunks of things and gags which she often does (very rarely on cheerios and puffs). I give her small pieces but it rarely matters because she'll eat the first few bites like a CHAMP and then decide she doesn't like it or gets tired of chewing or something and then EVERYTHING comes up.  We're talking exorcist, here. It's very often the entire contents of her stomach (i've noticed foods in her vomit from meals/snacks a couple hours previous).  Gagging and vomiting run in both sides of her family in babies.  Naturally after she's done being sick she's not interested in eating.  She takes 22-24oz of formula a day.
I guess my question is; is this okay? Should I be concerned she's getting enough nutrition? She's generally happy and not acting hungry and if she doesn't want to eat I don't want to push her to, but I do want to make sure she's getting enough. Have any of you experienced this? She eats less than the recommended amount for a baby her age.  Almost half as much!",1
"First of all, I‚Äôm really not trying to be rude here. It‚Äôs a genuine question and I would really appreciate some genuine answers.

I might be prejudiced because I live in the American south, but it really pisses me off when I see an overweight little kid that‚Äôs only 6 or 7 years old- and their lives are already ruined. Losing that weight as an adult is possible, but so much health damage, not to mention self-esteem and confidence, has already been done. It seems like you are handicapping them completely unnecessarily. I just want to understand how parents, who I have to assume love their kids and want the best for them, let their kids get fat.

"First of all, I'm not trying to badmouth the general standard of hygiene in China here. There's been plenty on that already and I've been here for 4 years so I've grown accustomed to certain things. No, my problem is with my in laws, the extended family and their friends. My Chinese wife is of minority farming stock and I sometimes feel *extremely* uncomfortable when some of them want to hold our baby, touch his mouth, face, hands and such.

"First off, I'm in no way even thinking about leaving my husband, and never even complain to my MIL about him.  But, that doesn't stop this lady!

A bit of background: I have two stepsons from my husband's first marriage that ended in a spectacular fashion (and not in a good way).  My husband and I run a family business.  Things have been tight the last year or so, especially with the addition of a baby in January.  In the past month or so, we've been presented with an opportunity to bring on a couple of partners and pick up a contract that will pretty much guarantee our income (and a hefty bonus) for at least the next 5 years.  This is HUGE for us.

But, in order to get all of this set up, my husband has to travel to meet with people, get contracts signed, and pretty much schmooze with partners and investors to bring a warm fuzzy feeling to everyone so that the opportunity pans out.  We've talked extensively about his travel.  We've managed to whittle down his traveling to 3 to 4 days a week.  I fully support his traveling because I know that this short term inconvenience will pay off big time for our family.  He's been traveling for about a month, and we probably have another month to go.

It all came to a head last week when one of the new partners invited everyone for a Sunday Motorcycle ride in his home town (hours away) for a good getting to know you/bonding"" type thing.  The boys (my stepsons) must have overheard part of the conversation  he doesn't need/want his mom's permission.  (As an aside he'd already decided that he wasn't going to go motorcycle riding due to his lack of skill and instead was going to leave here a couple of hours early than he was originally planning to meet up with everyone for dinner. There have been dinners That's annoying enough but Sunday while he's on the road he gets an email from his mom.  Here it is - names redacted: >[Husband] >You probably won't read this but I must make my opinion stated. I am extremely upset with you. You have 4 people depending on you and you are being irresponsible. I know that you have to be out of town for business. However >Mom He tells her to mind her own business.  She tells him she sees how things ended ""the last time"".  (As a side note  my husband's last marriage started when he was 18 and ended when he had to work out of town for long stretches of time to support the family and the (then)wife had her boyfriends move into the house while he was gone.)  When he talks to FIL to see what's setting her off My poor husband calls me from the road to make sure that we're ok - poor guy can't help but worry that he's going to come home and I'll have packed up everything and moved out just like his first wife did.  Nope.  We're still good. We all have baggage but throwing your son's baggage in his face because you don't like what he's doing is just plain wrong. She always invites us over for dinner when my husband is out of town  and I've always accepted because I figure the kids like to hang out with Grandma and Grandpa.  I never realized that this was some sort of pity party to make sure I don't leave her son.  I never realized that she was trying to ease the ""burden"" of taking care of 2 stepsons that I love dearly.  I don't enjoy dinner at their house.  Not only is conversation halting or about topics that I have no interest in it's obviously an unthinkable burden.  And we're having dinner again tonight  because I couldn't think of an excuse not to.  Between divorce dad's traveling they are great with the kids are good influences and like to be a presence in their lives.  We'd like to keep them around.  But the meddling drives me crazy.  Grandma has to be handled with kid gloves or ""Southern Charm"" because if she feel pushed aside Is there a way to politely deal with her?  Is there a way to politely decline dinner when my husband is out of town?  There can be no lies or half truths because she'll get the truth from the kids and then I have to explain why its ok for me to lie to Grandma but not ok for them to lie to me. Right now  I just grin and bear it.  I slip how excited I am for the new opportunity into conversations.  I brag about my husband to her when I get the chance.  I do a little verbal Tai Chi and redirect when she asks too personal of questions. I'll let my husband deal with his mom [End Rant] Hope your days are better and uncomplicated.""",6
"First off, let me be perfectly clear. My husband is amazing with our daughter- he's patient, loving, willing to help and hold, changes diapers, plays on the floor with her, and has been since day 1. He doesn't have a temper, and takes care of her a lot when he's home. I'm the primary caregiver and I'm ebf but it's not like she never sees him. He spends tons of time with her when he is here.
We're sitting at dinner tonight, she's in her high chair where she sits while we eat. She's been cranky the last few days but nothing special with me or him. She was in a good mood. He leaned in to say something to her and her face just soured and she started screaming and crying big fat tears and wouldn't settle down for like 10 minutes. She finally settled down, on my lap, and he said something to her and she went off again- big fat tears, screaming, scared face, the whole 9 yards. Took me almost 15 minutes to calm her down. It happened again about 5 minutes later and he basically hid from her the rest of the night. I had some work to do, and he held her by picking her up from behind, and was able to talk with her in his arms. He is heartbroken and is scared its going to happen again tomorrow.
Please tell me this isn't unusual, that there's at least a good chance its just a short phase. He is so sad and my heart is sad for him too. And her! Why would she suddenly be scared of him? Any advice? Thanks in advance.",6
"First off, she is my first child. She is 6 months in about a week. Breastfed, and sometime bottle fed as well.
Lately shes been having trouble sleeping, she gets real fussy, and every time i offer her my breast she pulls away. Until i give her a warm bottle, and i hold her in my lap as she falls asleep. She sleeps on the bed with me and my husband. We found it very easy when she awakes at night for feeding. Usually 1-2 times a night.
I might be sounding a bit selfish, but I miss being able to sleep on the bed and cuddle my husband. I would like for her to start sleeping on the crib on her own. She has two, her night time crib, and her nap time crib.
Plenty of question coming up. . . I know the basics, give her a warm bath, a feeding, then put her in the crib and let her cry it out until she falls asleep. But sometimes she just cries so hard that she starts to sweat, I always feel so bad, and i don't know if it is okay to let her cry so much!
If i do sleep train, do I start in the evening or early morning? Do I let her cry it out during nap time? Will she be confused having two cribs? As for breastfeeding, do i have to pump nightly? (if she sleeps throughout the night) And if she wakes up at night, do i feed her and let her cry it out again?
Help, im really confused, and very frustrated. By the way the night time crib is in our bedroom as well, so if any advice on noises. I dont want to have to always be sneaking in my own bedroom.
Thank you all!",6
"First time mom here. So I just started my 6 month old on solids (rice cereal) for one meal a day (usually in the evening) and he seems to love eating it and feeling the new texture in his mouth, however an hour after eating he gets really cranky and his stomach gets tight and it takes me a long time to calm him down. I have only done it for 2 days now (same symptoms both days) and I'm wondering if these are signs that he's not ready for solids, if he's allergic, if I'm doing it wrong (I'm waiting an hour or so after nursing him and then mixing his cereal with warm water), or something else. Any good advice on how to proceed?†",2

If a portion of the purchase went back to your child's school, would you be more likely to purchase? 4. Are you more likely to purchase once a year (i.e. back-to-school) or throughout the year?

"From 15-18 months he had actually lost .8lb according to their scale but the doctor wrote it off to different scales (they have two offices). However he had only gained about a lb from 12-15 months. Essentially since 9 months old he's gained 3lbs His pediatrician has given me lectures on nutrition and how I need to make sure his calories count. Well yes I know this. It's something I've studied on my own as I'm a health nut. It's what my sister is in school for. I have a good understanding on nutrition and how to feed an other human being ncluding a toddler. Thing is He limits himself to bananas apples toast (my mother gives him this) and string cheese. He recently tried hummus for the first time which was HUGE for us since he normally hates that texture. He'll eat 1/2 in a sitting if I let him.  A pediatrician friends of mine told me to try supplement drinks but my son won't touch them. I've tried many many brands at this point. Most my son will have is a Jamba Juice and I have them add just about every boost they have. But he is so damn picky I can't even copy cat it at home and just reuse the cup. He has to GO to the damn store and get it there and will only accept the cup from the person who makes it. Trust me. I've tried. Many times. It's like he needs the experience of the store to drink it. Sorry I'm rambling... Point is he's picky as fuck but will still eat ""plenty"" of the things he does like. These things aren't dense in calories though.  The doctor didnt say anything about his weight gain this time since this appt wasn't about that and I didn't want to point it out and hear yet an other lecture about my failure to feed him. I'm jut afraid that come his 2yr appt in two months he may not have gained anything and again I'll get told he isn't gaining enough and how bad a job I am doing feeding him. Despite only being 23 (maybe 24) lbs he's growing though! He's 99 percentile for height and I know his foot has grown cuz I just had to get him bigger shoes. It's just he's struggled to put on and keep the three lbs he's gained since he was 9 months old. Anyone else just have a skinny kid who doesn't put on much weight?

"Have you heard of the website ask.fm? It is fast becoming a popular social network for high school age students. 
The site started in the summer of 2010 but has really seemed to pick up steam in the last few months. If you have a teen-aged child odds are very good that they or their friends are using this site.
The site is very basic and some of its popularity is likely due to the post-facebook"" aesthetic that it displays. It is very simple and easy to use.Users sign up and they have a page that allows users to post questions for them either attached to their name or anonymously. The user then answers the question with a post of their own. Many times the questions aren't actually questionsSeems silly right? There is a somewhat dark side to this site mainly due to the ease of anonymous commenting. The anonymity allows and seems to encourage students to say some pretty nasty things to each other. On the tamer side it is very popular to give a user a ""rating"" out of 10 or assign a ""date/pass"" either anonymously or with a name attached. On the other side of the scale is pretty clear harassment and bullying.The site is based out of Latvia and has very few of the reporting or parental control features typical of many social networking sites and has been linked to a few teen suicides worldwide as a result of online harassment and bullying. 
I'm not trying to fearmonger here by any means. Most kids seem to be using the site in their harmless but annoying teenage way. The potential for nastiness is always present though.

"Hello all! 

My little man is a little over 6 months old and wakes for a feeding every 3 - 4 hours at night.  When people ask how he sleeps and I tell them this they seem mortified... Am I doing something wrong or is this normal?

He is in the 95th percentile (21 lbs at 6 months) and takes out 6 - 8 oz when he wakes so I know that he is hungry and not just wanting to be comforted.  Even when I tell some people this (particularly family), they say that this is because, I have gotten him on that schedule I can't imagine doing this- leaving him to feel hungry and abandoned.  And honestly I don't mind these midnight feedings (Hubby and I only intend to have one so I try to absorb every moment of little baby time :P )  but am I messing him up somehow?  With the amount of people I having going on about it I am starting to second guess myself here.  I truly want what is best for him.  We have tried several little things... Swaddling (when he was younger) sleep sacks noise machines Thank you for reading my first post :).  Your opinions are appreciated!  """,6
"Hello all,
I am looking for advice on how much my 7.5 month old should be eating. She seems to want solid food way more than formula right now and I don't know if I should be concerned. I have looked at the baby center guide, but that talks a lot about rice cereal and purees only, which we have chosen not to do. Here is her typical day:
7am 6oz bottle
8am greek yogurt with fruit, 1/4 piece whole grain toast
11am 6oz bottle
12pm chicken/meat and veg
3pm 6oz bottle
5ishpm meat and veg (whatever we are eating)
630 5 oz bottle
She will snack on Cheerios as well in the afternoon sometimes

She will sometimes finish her bottles, but lately has been leaving at least an ounce left, but will devour solid foods. She is small and always has been small (max 5-10%).
I know the saying is food before 1 is just for fun, but I feel like I am having to force formula on her even at this age and cannot imagine her still getting most of her nutrition from formula by the time she is 1 at the rate we are going. ",2
"Hello all. My son is almost 8 weeks old and we've been told we need to start teaching him to sleep on his own or it will be very difficult to convince him later. Our previous night time routine was I put him to sleep in the bassinet by the bed, he wakes up every hour or couple of hours for food, then there's a point where he just cries until I bring him to bed and he falls instantly asleep without a feeding. I take that to mean he just wants comfort and how can I deny him that? So from around 2 am on (he usually settles down for sleep around 10 pm) I bring him to bed to co sleep. Now while sleep training, I put him in the bassinet as usual, feed him or comfort him when he wakes and put him right back in the bassinet. Last night was our first night trying this and it was after a full day of no napping because I wasn't allowing him to sleep for long in my arms. When he fell asleep, I'd put him in the bassinet and he'd wake. Normally, I'll do that a couple times and he may sleep fine alone or he may not. If he doesn't want to sleep alone that day, I'll hold him or wear him because I figured he needed to sleep regardless or he's be overtired (which he certainly was last night). He slept alright last night, but nowhere near as restfully as he usually does. He woke about every 30 or 40 mins and tried a bunch of times to just fall asleep beside me without feeding. So... long storey short, I'm really sad this morning after doing this for 24 hours because I feel like him sleeping with me or on me is the treasured reward I get for waking up and coaxing him to sleep a million times. It's the reward for the lack of sleep I get. It's the loveliest feeling in the world and I feel like my son feels the same. So why do I have to stop? I know it will be better for him to learn to sleep on his own. I don't want to have him in our room until he's 2 years old. My husband would never want that. Also, when other people have him overnight, they're not going to want to sleep with him (and I certainly wouldn't trust them to). So i know I have to help him learn, but I feel like I'm losing one of my favourite parts of parenting. Maybe even my favourite part. So now when he wakes, i feed him and help him calm and then I have to just give him up when I know he'd rather cuddle and I sure as hell would rather cuddle. It makes me sad that I'll never feel him snuggle into me again and use my breast as the best pillow. Or wake to see his little fingers wrapped around my own. I'm crying as a write this. Co sleeping gives me so much joy, and i know I've had 8 weeks to enjoy it so now it's time to help him learn to be more independent. And last night he managed to stay in the bassinet all night so I know he's able and it's not ruining his life completely, so that's something. I'm just going to really really really miss sleeping curled up with my son. It was my favourite thing. And I can't confuse him and let him sleep with me sometimes and sometimes not. I have to help him understand that bassinets and cribs are for sleeping, not mummy's bed. It just makes me very sad.",6

Everyone has thus far chalked it up to his 'rough start' he was a late crawler (we didn't think he would) and now at 18 months he's not walking. He can pull himself up on stuff and shimmy around, but not walking on his own yet.
He had his 18 month check up yesterday and the NP is worried about his lack of walking and talking. He says 'mom' and 'dad' and babbles. He has tone, and inflection, and facial expressions when he does but I was unaware that he should be saying more words. He understands what hungry and snack mean. He responds when you ask if he's thirsty. But I guess his lack of saying 'cup' or whatever is cause for concern.
She (the NP) keeps insisting that he MUST have something wrong with him. There has to be something medically wrong with him that would explain his birth defects and this development delay. But I don't feel that way, she compared it to down syndrome not that he has downs but something akin to that, and keeps pushing to talk to a geneticist, which we already have and they had nothing to say.
I don't know what to do moms (and dads lurking). I feel like a bad mom because my baby is behind. Have I not done something right? I read to him, I play with him, I talk to him all day. I'm considering taking him to get evaluated (again) because I don't want him to be behind, and I feel terrible because my friends babies are doing things that he should already be doing. I also think that I should switch doctors, I always feel worse when I leave. What do you think?
TL;DR My DS is not walking or talking at 18 months, doctor thinks he has some sort of medical condition that explains everything and it makes me depressed.
If any of you read through all of this I love you, and have an ehug <3  ",6
"Hello Moms of Reddit!
My dear friend is pregnant with her first baby and having a baby shower this Sunday. While I already have something for the baby (knitted myself) I would really want to get my friend something to remind her to take care of herself as well. 

I'm talking hard-core pampering here. She likes hair, makeup etc, or at least she has liked before the baby.
The problem I have is I think too much. At first I wanted to get her a gift certificate for a day spa or a hair dresser. I immediately went on to imagine her thinking when on earth do you think I have the time to get my hair done?! I have a baby!"". Then I thought about a basket of masks She's really not even like that  she's very appreciative TL;DR: My friend is having her first baby in a few weeks. What kind of pampering / small luxury would have you appreciated for yourself when your first baby was born?""",6

But for the last few months ive noticed that he will eat better if i let him walk around while he eats, like not literally walking or running around but like if i put the food on the coffee table or hold he will wat it better than if i put him in his high chair. Ive always believed in eating at the table i love it i was raised that way but sometimes i dont make him because i really want him to eat a good amount!

"Hello parents of Reddit!!!
New parents here.  Well, kind of.  Our baby is almost 9.5 months old now, and wanted to ask you guys a few questions!
We don't really have too much interaction with kids his age, nor do we know a lot of people with kids his age so we were curious about a few things in his development, whether or not he is a bit behind, or advanced, or right on par. We have asked our pediatrician a few, but we still have so many unanswered questions!  
I know this post sounds like a comparison, but that's really not the point of this post.  We're not trying to brag, but this is our first child, and in some areas, he seems really advanced.  We just want to get some real word ideas for what to expect next, and whether or not we're having a skewed perspective of our child.  
1) He's 23 pounds 2) approx 30 inches 3) wears a size 3 shoe 4) socks are 12-24 month socks 5) says 3 words consistently and understandably 6) does a few gestures, like waving, and up for when he wants to be held. 7) still wakes up many times at night (he co-sleeps with us) (probably due to being a light sleeper) but he fusses a lot at night.
8) He understands how to use buttons, like the tv touch buttons, iphone/ipad buttons to turn them on/off
9) he's eating small finger foods, refuses to be hand fed/spoon fed but still seems to enjoy breastfeeding
10) He can crawl normally, and pulls himself up to cruise alongside objects such as couches and the entertainment center.
11) He walks when holding on to your hand and fingers for the last 2 months now.
12) He knows his name. 13) He shares his toys and food (he tries to feed us) 14) He skipped the sippy cup, and went straight for drinking out of cups.  (we feed him water through a Contigo water bottle regularly now)
15) He has 6 teeth and a 7th is about to pop out
16) He has a good understanding of spacial awareness.  He knows when something is hidden behind something and tries to look around the blocking object.  (he still has a short memory, so will often forget about it)",3
"Hello reddit parents. I'm sure some of you have been here and could use some advice. This new parenting experience id driving a huge wedge in our marriage.
Our son is about to turn 1. Since he was born my husband and I have been growing apart. It is now at a point where he is barely speaking to me and only wants to play video games when he's not doing stuff around the house or with the baby. It's almost like he refuses to spend his free time with me. I get some people need their space and I'm all for him having his hobbies. That's why I've been patient and tolerant of this. We have not had a date night since the baby was born because of his separation anxiety, which I am to blame"" according to my husband. We have no family near us and every nanny I've hired quits because of how bad this separation anxiety is. From my standpoint I've felt all his proposed solutions revolve around ""undoing the wrong things I've made."" One example of my so-called wrong-doing: breastfeeding. Our son has never wanted to take bottles. I tried tirelessly and spent a small fortune trying out different bottles but he always refused the bottle and tried to rip my shirt off. A lot of people suggested daddy had to feed him but daddy could not handle the crying and we gave up on the bottle thing. Our baby is now at a sippy cup stage but still breastfeeds constantly and never takes milk (not even expressed b.milk) from it. Another point of contention is my husband's lack of patience for having a crying baby. We're talking about loud cursing (yes in front of the baby) Talking is not really working. I somehow end up being the evil person for defending my viewpoints. Lately all I have done has been listen take it and say nothing. But reddit  If you have been here before how did you get out of the rut? And dads THANKS""",6
"Hello there! My 6 month old seems to be starting to sleep through the night-ish however I am not quite sure he is ready to drop a night feed as we just started solids and he hardly takes in anything (he has also been a bit slow with weight gain in the past but looks very healthy and has met all milestones on time/early). He is also waking earlier than usual (no doubt because he is hungry) but too close to wake up time to put him back down after feeding him. Without the night feed, he nurses 5 times a day. 
My questions are: do I wake him for a night feed until solids are better established? Right now he is asleep by 7pm but waking at 6am - do I just go with the flow with an earlier wake time for now and just start his day at 6 and shift his first nap earlier? Thanks! ",6
"Hello there, not sure if this is the most appropriate place to post but I do need some help so I'll give it a try. 
I religiously take my birth control - Loestrin 24 Fe - and ironically enough, I took a pregnancy test today and it is positive. I took one because my breasts seem more sensitive, full, I was bored, and I did gain some weight - which then again might have been due to being stuck in the house for the past week while Hurricane Sandy took over the place - but I am also extremely paranoid in that area. The only thing I can blame is about 4 weeks ago I was prescribed antibiotics - not sure of the name - and I questioned the Doctor whether it would interfere with my birth control in which he said no"" and laughed at me for being so paranoid >=/. I give this background to prove I am not some idiot who recklessly had sex without any form of contraceptives and now wants to rid of the consequences of my actions.
With that being said  having a child right now is going to deprive my boyfriend and I of success - which will reflect how well we can provide for the child -  which is why I think abortion is the best way to go about this. We're both full-time students And so I have the following questions that hopefully will help in some way: 
-If any women have experienced abortion; what were the results of it physically mentally  did your partner's abortion affect you in any way? What form of abortion was received as there are many to from unfortunately?  any experiences with that? Terminating the pregnancy seems as if it will be a very hard thing to go through with  as I am an avid fan of babies and children and cannot wait to experience that part of my life Thanks for reading.
 tldr; Religiously took b.c but seems to have failed due to the ingestion of antibiotics  now contemplating having an abortion and want to know if anyone else has experienced one and what affects were left behind; mentally 
UPDATE: I had an ultrasound done and was 6 weeks along - it was also around 6 weeks ago that I took antibiotics. I made the very difficult decision to go through with the medical abortion this past week. My hormones are all out of whack right now but I think I made the right decision. Thank you all for sharing your intimate experiences. """,6
"Hello! †My little one is four months, and he had a small rash behind his knees when we went to the doctor for his checkup, so the doctor recommended Eucerin. †We started putting that on him, but the rash has spread. †It is usually just flesh-colored little bumps, but heat makes it very red and splotchy-looking. He is breastfed, and there have really been no changes in my diet or in my detergent. Could Eucerin be making it worse? †Has anyone else had this problem? †Thanks for any help.",6
"Hello! I am a recent (like, really recent) divorcee. I do not have children of my own, but about six months ago I started dating someone with a two year old daughter (we've known each other for about a year prior). Things were really awesome at first - kids have always generally liked me without me really trying. That's what it was like with me and her daughter (at first). She would let me read to her, we'd go shopping for new shoes/clothes for her, and we'd binge watch Disney movies together and sing all the songs.
About a month into our relationship (yeah, that soon) her kid's mom left the picture (full disclosure, my girlfriend is transgender, the daughter is from her previous marriage before transitioning). It was really stressful at first - I mean like, SUPER stressful. We are both professors and for about a week we were bringing the baby with us to work. Fortunately, our bosses were really cool/understanding about it, and she was pretty cooperative and more than happy to sit during lectures with her toys or with snacks. We super lucked out shortly after however, and found someone who was a stay at home mom who agreed to watch her while I was at work. Girlfriend is a full time professor, and I was only part time, so I still would pick her up after lunch and we'd hang out at the apartment until daddy"" was home. At this point  things were still pretty great. Baby has been through some SUPER BIG changes (her mom which was really exciting and awesome (and adorable). Fast forward a few months. I'm not sure if her 'development' (i.e.  the onset of terrible twoness) was stunted because of the less-than-ideal conditions she'd been living in prior to aforementioned events etc. Girlfriend doesn't like telling her no  I think partly out of guilt but also because when the baby starts yelling/hitting it makes her anxious. Her past relationship was emotionally abusive and I think it's really stayed with her in a lot of bad ways  and it makes it hard for her to handle things when tensions get high. Meanwhile  I am more and more finding myself falling into the role of 'rules-lawyer'. I really the one where King Theoden laughs and says ""YOU HAVE NO POWER HERE  except I'm the worst Gandalf ever and seriously have no idea how to encourage her to tantrum less/generally behave more positively. We don't do spanking, and we don't yell at her, and I don't think either of those things would help or accomplish anything anyway.
Where she used to be pleasant and fun 99% of the time, it seems like now she finds a way to pick a fight about everything - it's constant battles from breakfast to bedtime. So far the only solution I've found is to exhaust the crap out of her. As far as we know, the few times we've taken her to the sitter's for a night to get a break, she hasn't behaved this way, but this may be because she's got another kid her age to play with there. 
Most of the time, if it's just me and her, the constant tantrums are frustrating but manageable. I can usually stay calm until it's over and laugh about it later, although the fights over her eating the breakfast she has spent the past 20 minutes LITERALLY BEGGING FOR are exhausting only because I am such a grump in the morning and usually don't have time to get a cup of coffee until after she's fed. However, some days, like today, she is just extra awful. 
Here's an example: she'll scream she wants something. We ask her to say please, and she does, and we offer her the item. She frowns, says she doesn't want it, starts whining repeatedly saying she doesn't want it until she works herself into tears and more screaming. We leave it on her table, and eventually she will reclaim said item, but only after carrying on about it for a solid ten to fifteen minutes. Rinse and repeat for virtually every activity or item or meal etc throughout the day, on a bad day.
I don't have kids, but I'm ASSUMING this is those terrible twos"" I've heard so much about. I'm really worried however that this might be aberrant behavior  possibly because of losing contact with mom or something Girlfriend doesn't like this because it makes her yell and cry more until she finally gives in. I'm not really sure what the correct solution is. Instinctively I am not inclined to give in when she's throwing a fit  because I feel like it's rewarding that kind of behavior. However We're both under a lot of stress besides the kid and on top of all the other things I am worried about and girlfriend's work has been loading her up with projects and she has no office hours or time to do them and has to choose between spending time with her daughter or working from home. We're going to be moving soon back to girlfriend's hometown to be near her siblings so that we can get breaks and have 'us' time and so kiddo can spend time with her aunts/uncles/grandmother  but until then things are really  really tense. If you read all this crap I apologize for the EXTREMELY LONG POST. I'm just at the end of my rope here. What are some things you guys do to positively redirect this behavior? Is she just not getting enough exercise? I know when we do go out to the park or for a walk with the dogs she is a lot more manageable Also  the icing on the cake and then yelled at me to change her/yelled at me to stop changing her/yelled at me for underwear/yelled for a diaper/generally just kind of screamed a lot  which is understandable when you've peed yourself several times in one day and are quite tired of being smelly and wet. Everything I'd read online said to just 'put her in underwear and she'd start asking for the toilet on her own' and that does not seem to be the case. I did ask her every 30 minutes or so if she had to potty and put her on the potty several times  and she always seemed to pee right after I'd ask and she said 'no' TL;DR: Help me mommit-wan kenobi  you're my only hope.""",6
"Hello! I'm in a very bizarre situation, and I would like some input from some like minded situations. I apologize about how absurd this sounds, and I swear that I'm not trolling.
So, a little background about us. We are both in our mid 30s, and immigrated to Canada about 8 years ago. Both of us grew up in relatively impoverished conditions (based on western standards), and pushed through university. We got married, and we moved to Canada when I received a job offer here.
A few months later, he found employment and over the years, we've become upper middle class. We have a decent income with a nice home and I am grateful that we have been this fortunate. We're both pretty frugal folk as well, so other than the basic living commodities and 2 laptops, our house is basically devoid of personality or decoration. We basically put our money into the house, bills, food, and savings.
At this point, we feel that our careers are more or less secured and we've begun to plan having a child. This is where the question comes in.
My husband is pretty adamant about raising our child in a sort of pseudo-low class environment. Basically, this means that we will move into a small apartment, and rent out our house. He doesn't want to compromise the child's development or potential so we will still send them to a good school and buy healthy food for them. However, (after infancy), we will buy them very few toys (birthdays and Christmas) and basically just pretend to be poor until the kid is in their teens, probably when they start high school. We'll encourage the kid to have a small job like delivering flyers to earn some pocket change (which my husband will accompany them on for safety reasons).
So now you're probably wondering, what's his reasoning? Well, in a nutshell, he wants to raise a kid who values hard work and has a humble attitude towards life.
In his words (I'm paraphrasing a bit here), he wants to raise the kid to not rely on or value material luxuries, and to appreciate the little things. In addition, he feels that his approach will teach the kid to work hard for things that they do want and teach good values.
I can kind of understand where he's coming from, since the country we originate from has a HUGE wage gap, and the new generation of rich kids seem incredibly spoiled and elitist. Moving isn't really a big problem since we don't have that much property to haul around, and I personally don't mind living in a small apartment since it's still much bigger than the place I grew up in.
However, I'm just worried if we'll be putting the child at risk by doing this. Is this a good idea? I can understand where he's coming from but it still seems kind of unnecessarily complicated and potentially harmful. Asking our friends has yielded some polarizing viewpoints, and I'd like to get a few more perspectives on this.
Opinions would be appreciated. Thank you!
TL;DR: Husband and I are planning a kid. Husband wants to raise them in a pseudo-low class environment to teach good values. I'm not sure how to feel.
**UPDATE** After seeing the overwhelmingly negative reactions to this idea, as well as some good counter arguments, I've talked to him about it, and we've come around and decided that we'll skip the whole apartment thing. We still feel like it's important to teach good work ethic and appreciation of money so we'll still try to get them to do chores for pocket change and maybe get a paper route. Thank you for your replies and time everyone, I'm afraid I don't have the time to thank you all personally but I have read all of your comments. Once again, thank you!",6

"Hello, 
I have a five year old and I honestly think I am failing as a mom. Problem number one. My son is obsessed with TV, IPad and computer and is only five. That is all he wants to do all day. It is very rare to find him actually playing with anything else. He has cars, trains, planes, legos, at supplies, play dough but all he wants is TV. And I'm tired of this fight. How can I make him enjoy doing different things. 
He wants to eat in front of the TV, he doesn't want to get out of the house. I honestly think  we are being terrible parents allowing him so much screen time.
Problem number two and what kills me even more is he doesn't want to eat on his own. He wants to be spoon fed at five! My one year can eat by himself but not the five year old. My husband thinks I shouldn't get mad and just feed him, make the foods he likes, because he is too skinny in the 25th percentile and wants our son to gain weight. 
I'm tired of fighting with my son to grab the effing spoon and put food in his mouth and swallow. I am guilty of accepting my sons nagging to watch TV and eat, but even then he just sits there with the plate full in front of him. I'm tired I don't want to fight and scream anymore. I just want him to eat his food.

"Hello, 
my son is 10,5 months old and lately developed the habit to scream. all. the. fucking. time. I think I'm going mad about this. He wakes up and gets his bottle (that he usually doesn't want) and a new diaper, is happy for about one hour at maximum and then the screaming starts. He will scream if I dare to move, he will crawl way and then scream, he will scream while being fed because he wants more although he's still eating, he will scream when he DOESN'T want food any more, he will scream when his pacifier is not there, he will scream WHEN it's there and throw it away... Literally the whole day is full of him screaming and crying.
I have to take him to work two-three days a week because I have no option of daycare (not to mention what would happen if I leave the room), and although we have an extra room, he's screaming and screaming. 
And when he's getting tired and approaching nap time, those screams turn into fucking hellish sounds of terror. But then, on the other hand, he does not WANT to sleep and prefers to scream in what I assume to be pain and agony from tiredness. He will literally only sleep when I physically restrain him on my lap and quickly oscillate my legs so that he's rocked"" to sleep. (And then the naps only take about half an hour and there are  ad maximum I've already got some medication for teething  because I've heard that there are some pretty painful teeth coming out at that time It's making me mad. He will sit literally one meter apart from me and scream bloody terror and I find myself screaming back at him ""WELL COME HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THERE""  because I can't pick him up everytime he goes some place and then is unhappy to be there. He's an adept crawler It might be hunger  I thought And what doesn't help either is a husband who sees him literally three hours a day but in this time managed to aquire all the wisdom about our son I can't take it any more. I wonder how babies do not get ear damage from crying so much. I try to do all I can to make him happy but literally EVERYTHING sends him into anger and rage.

"hello, hope i'm posting this in the right sub, i just need some advice...
my son recently started going to daycare for the first time this week, and its been...hard...for everyone. the first day, my son wasn't fed enough food and was grumpy at the end of the day, and he was understandably a bit upset that mom or dad wasn't with him. the daycare person asked if my son was always loud, which i said yes, he is a loud baby. he has strong lungs and he uses them when he is upset. i apologized. the second day, i had to leave work early to pick him up because the daycare provider said he wasn't eating well and was whining all day. my wife asked me to get him, which i gladly did. i got home and my son was happy as a clam, drank his bottle just fine, napped great and we had a fun afternoon. that says to me that he is just having some separation anxiety.
this morning we dropped him off and he was a bit clingy. the daycare mentioned that she hadnt used his pacifier at all the last 2 days because she had forgotten about it. thats fine, we just told her to use it when he was grumpy or going for a nap.
i get several texts today asking if its normal for my son to yell randomly and talk so loud. i tell her that ya, he is loud and he will vocally tell you when he is bored or whatnot.
the daycare provider dosent really like this, it seems, because she said that shed been giving him the pacifier and feeding him all day to try and keep him quiet because he is disrupting the other children"". i dont really like that im just stressing out immensely right now. its hard enough to find a daycare provider that my wife and i trust and like and that our son likes  now we have to worry if they can handle a child who is loud and eats more(he is in 24m clothes at 12m does anyone have any advice that could possibly make the daycare transition easier for everyone involved? we really do like this daycare provider and want it to work out because we met some really bad ones  but im wearing thinÖ thanks -_-""",1

"Hello, Mommit! After our daughter's one-year Dr appointment we were advised to begin weaning her off the bottle and baby formula. The baby formula went really well- she went straight to whole milk with no constipation, no gassiness or fussiness-- but now we're trying to wean her from the bottle and it's proven to be very difficult. She does not want the sippy cup. She'll use it sometimes for juice or water but when it comes to milk she absolutely will not take it. We've tried different sippy cups too-- staw ones, plastic ones, etc and she doesn't like them. She wants the bottle. 
She's also a very bad eater. She wasn't big on baby food and now that she has teeth the only things she will eat are crackers, Cheerio-s and yogurt. She doesn't like fruit, meat, or vegetables.
Please help me mommit, she's been crying all day for the bottle and I seriously feel like I'm about to cry too.

"Hello, Mommit!
I just turned 21 a few weeks ago in July and my daughter (first and only) turned six months a few days ago.  Before I start, I would like to say that she is my everything and my best/favorite part of the day, always, and none of my stress/frustration is because of her or her actions.  I love her and the joy I have from being a mother is what gets me through the day most of the time.
To start, I work full time (40 hrs a week) in a family day care where my daughter comes with me.  It is me and the provider/business owner, and when I am there, my daughter is my responsibility because we have another 3 month old infant who my boss cares for throughout the day, and we both take care of the eight other children enrolled in the program.  While I would never change this aspect of my life for anything else, there is still an incredible amount of stress I feel while at my job and while I'm at home because of my job.

In a couple days, I am going back to school full time.  Four three-credit courses.  I had to take an incomplete for one of my courses last semester because I had my daughter, so I have to finish the workload for that course by December or I will fail.  My financial aid was taken away because I did this and I am relying on a scholarship to get my way through the next semester, but it still has not been approved and I fear it will not be.
I live in an apartment with my boyfriend, who works exclusively night hours.  I work 9:30-5:30, and he is walking out the door when I walk in.  So when I get home at the end of the day, my responsibility as a mother continues and sometimes I feel like a single mother doing all of the work.  I know this is unfair to my boyfriend, who helps me out financially and during the weekends, but over time, resentment has built within me and I simply can't help it.

We receive no help from our families and have only had two nights without her since she was born.  Both times my parents watched her, but they live over an hour and a half away and are certainly not around to swing by and help me if I'm struggling.  His parents both live around fifteen minutes away but have never helped me out or watched her even for an afternoon.  We are given no money for support and combined, we bring in around $2500 a month to cover rent, bills, gas, food, baby supplies, etc (we also live in MA which has a pretty high cost of living).  There are many nights without dinner for mom but I can deal as long as my daughter has food, which she always does.
My father is also in extremely poor health and on the heart transplant list, continuously in and out of the hospital for anywhere from days to weeks.  There is always a possibility, every day, that he could pass.  Even though I try not to dwell on it because my thoughts won't change reality, I can't help but have thoughts creep into my mind about how I wish he could see my daughter more and how I wish I could see him more.

So my question to all of you moms out there is: How do you cope?  How do you just live your life and move on every day?  How do you handle the stress?  I really want to go to the gym and start losing the baby weight, but especially with school starting, I cannot imagine adding anything else to my daily schedule.  I'm really anxious/worried about not being able to handle it, since I already struggle on a daily basis.  I'm so sleep deprived and exhausted and I feel like every day it gets worse.  Please, any advice is GREATLY appreciated.  Thank you in advance!  (Also, sorry for the wall of text!)",6
"Hello, r/mommit!
I just recently graduated from r/babybumps, my daughter, Alice Lynn, is 3 weeks old tomorrow, born on January 25th, 2013, at 4:57 pm, weighing 6.3 lbs., and measuring 18 inches. 
I immediately fell in love with my gorgeous daughter the moment I laid eyes on her. I had to have an emergency c-section, because baby girl was breech. She is perfectly healthy, if not a little small. She did lose about 9% of her weight during our stay in the hospital, and is slowly gaining it back. 
I was told I am perfectly fine to breast feed her. 
That's a little background on me. Now I have a question for all of you experienced moms out there. 
I love my daughter. I truly do. I don't THINK I am suffering from PPD...but I feel like I am close, because I have a lot of guilt. 
My husband and I decided last week to introduce Similac into Alice's diet, three or four bottles a day, because she is so small. I decided this because I felt....like a damn cow. I stopped feeling like a human. Alice would latch and stay on for literal hours. I was getting desperate. 
So when my husband bought me a pump and I started using it, Alice took to the bottle right away. I noticed that she fell asleep so quickly after about 6 oz. of milk. It gave me the idea that maybe formula would help, and I would get more than 15 minutes of consecutive  sleep. She slept for 5 whole hours the first night. I was so excited! 
When my mother-in-law asked us if there was anything we could use for the baby, we told her always more formula, as that stuff is pretty expensive! She looked at me and just lashed into me about how I'm killing my daughter and neglecting her and being selfish, and how she would go days without showering or setting her babies down. 
I...feel so guilty now. I feel guilty that I get antsy after a few hours of holding her, and feel like I need a break. 
She sleeps on my chest at night. That is actually my decision. I make sure my arms don't move from her, they haven't once. I am a very light sleeper. But...it does get hard.
I tried to just pump 20 oz. a day...but I just can't do it. It is painful for me, and difficult to nurse her or hold her and pump. I didn't get to leave the house for the first two weeks after we got home, and it drove me crazy. With the formula, we can leave, because we have food for her right there.
Can you please tell my your opinion here?? Should I throw the formula away, and deal with it?? 
Am I endangering my daughter by having her sleep on me?? Damaging her psychologically or something?? I would truly appreciate any opinions. Thank you for reading!
Oh, I'm a 22 year old female, and she is our first child. My husband is 25 and helps as much as he can. Just a little background!
Thanks again!!

"Hello,
I have the pleasure of working with a few Russians and they claim that many people in Russia potty train their children by the end of the first year.
One of them actually has a son and he said he is 1 and potty trained. Googling also confirms this is possible.
Has anyone tried it? Everyone makes it seem pretty easy. You essentially feed them then sit them on the toilet until they go to the bathroom. I'm curious to here love/horror stories regarding this method or any method that would achieve the same result.

"Hello. I'm fairly new to this subreddit, so forgive me for this wall of text.
We all know that the AAP recommends breastfeeding exclusively for the first 6 months. And I had fully intended to follow that recommendation. I even toyed with the idea of extended breastfeeding, because my son is at such high risk of type 1 diabetes. 
Obviously, I had no idea how incredibly difficult it could be, and in the first few months, every feeding was dreaded and painful. But I got through it and by month three, I was delighted to feed him. I felt like I could breastfeed him through college. And then I went back to work.
Almost immediately, my milk supply dropped to seemingly nothing. I could not pump enough for my boyfriend to feed him full while I was working. And I couldn't very well quit. And then the damnable day came when I had to call home, I have to stay another two hours. I think you'll have to go buy some formula"". But it wasn't so bad I thought. I can still breastfeed in the evening and on my days off that I had to stop breastfeeding during the day. So  here I am  no hesitance with no choice but to formula feed until 4 PM. And more and more often we're supplementing one of the night time feedings with half a bottle of formula. I'm almost at the six month mark and my boyfriend says that will be good enough It will be like when the doctors told us about the ABO incompatibility and hyperbilirubinemia and the risk of brain damage and ""if the UV treatment doesn't work Something that I couldn't possibly have known about or avoided yet I was heartbroken for days. Only throwing up in the hospital because he ate one too many graham crackers. Joint problems impending blindness. And cruellest of all  they made me test for gestational diabetes A hundred years ago he would have died twice. First because of my stupid  but I can't shake the feeling of having failed. What do you do about it?""",6

"Help! I feel like our 10-month-old daughter is eating CONSTANTLY! I was discussing with my husband the other day that she only spent about an hour playing during the entire day. The rest of the time she was napping or eating.
Here's a normal day for us:  
Wake up & nurse  
Eat a big bowl (about half an adult serving) of oatmeal+applesauce  
Play   
Nap  
Eat a big bowl of some meat/veggie mash  
Right after the mash, feed herself some banana chunks

We've been putting her to bed around 8 but she doesn't actually fall asleep for any length of time until after 11. Last night it was 3AM before she actually slept for more than an hour. Horrible!    

What gives? It's like she can't get enough food. She just started pulling herself up to stand, so maybe it's a growth spurt? What else can I do? I'm losing my mind not being able to relax after she goes to bed. ",2

"Here is the story: My sister has been living with my parents for over two years now.  They have provided everything that she has asked and more, and have asked nothing in return except to clean up a little around the house.  She has had jobs on and off, and is now going to nursing school full time, and has no job at the moment.  She has a two year old daughter, the father gets her twice a month for 3 days each visit (which he doesn't take her often), so my sister has her the rest of the time. However, she does not actually have her for that long, she often take her to her husbands grandma's house and leaves her there for a few days; because her daughter is 'too much to handle'.  
My sister does not take care of her daughter for the majority of the time, usually it's my parents.  They bathe her, change her diapers, feed her real food (not hot dogs and a mac and cheese every meal like my sister), and play with her.  My sister ignores her daughter, yells at her when she doesn't listen to her, gets into her stuff, or is too loud; and when I mean yell, I really mean the nasty yelling you hear two grown adults doing when they argue and have had a few too many drinks.  She pawns her daughter off on my parents, goes out and doesn't come back, leaving my dad to watch her child; because she is too much to handle
She now has no place to live and has left her child at her great grandmas house for almost a week now  alone...not one visit.  I am worried for my niece.  My sister may give custody to the father I just don't know what to do  I would take my niece in a heartbeat (so would my parents) but my sister doesn't think she is doing anything wrong and thinks she is a great parent; she can't see what she is doing and we have tried talking to her -many times- trying to be respectful I am afraid what will happen to my niece climbs up something falls breaks a leg I just don't know if this is even abuse  maybe I am over reacting TLDR: My sister is neglectful of her child  the father (who she doesn't live with) may be hitting her. My parents who took care of my sister and her child had enough abuse and kicked her out. Sister has no where to live and hasn't seen her daughter in almost a week (left her at great grandma's house).  Is this abuse",6

"He's turning 9 months old in a few days (with 8 teeth) and he's never liked jar food.

What can he have? What spices and foods are off limits? What shape/size should I cut the food into? Also, I want to know if he can specifically have garlic, corn, cheese, tomatoes, and cinnamon.

My SO feeds him and he is perfectly fine. I understand that he absolutely adores my SO (not his Biological Father) like literally adores him, he kisses him and hugs him more than he does me!

"Hey all, I was just curious if any of you introduced solid foods early. My daughter is ten weeks old, and mom is having a really tough time keeping up with breastfeeding. I know all the medical orgs say exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months at least, but it's getting to the point where my girlfriend just can't keep up with having to nurse every 2-3 hours. She's taking supplements and staying hydrated and all that stuff, so I really think it's more that our daughter is in the 90th percentile for weight, and just needs more than she can get. We'll ask our pediatrician about it, too, but I was just wondering what your experiences have been. **EDIT: I should have mentioned that she had a clogged duct that led to an infection about a week ago. Since then, her supply has dropped off considerably and our daughter is not eating nearly as much as she was beforehand. When she's not nursing, she's pumping to try to bring up her supply again, but with a full university course load it's really difficult.**",1

"Hey fellow mom & dads! I'm wondering if anyone else has this issue. My son is 6 yrs old and in the first grade. I'm going to start by saying my son is not super spoiled or coddled. It seems as if he neve grew out of his terrible twos. 
When he doesn't get what he wants or i tell him no he freaks out! I'm talking drops the floor, or stomps feet with hands on head and screaming. I don't spank not saying i haven't, when I have it was a reaction to running out it street where i catch hand before he makes it and a slight tap or trying to touch stove while its on. For this behavior he sits on his bed in his room for five minutes of quiet time. The five minutes starts once he settles down and is quiet.
Just some information I think is important is all my kids wake up at same time everyday. They eat their meals at the same time and go to bed at same time daily, and always have. So structure isn't a factor. Other than these tantrums, which can be 2-5 a day, he is a happy child. He plays and is very inventive and loves all super heroes. 
In school he is struggling with reading. Its very frustrating for him, when I do his homework with him he gets discouraged at not knowing a word he's trying to read. He will guess first then when I tell him to sound it out he 'spazzes' we take a couple minute break of me explaining that all he has to do is sound out and its OK not to know but he should try. He sounds it out and usually gets its right. 
I've talked to pediatrician about ADD, spoke with his teacher an she doesn't think that's it. We go back to Dr Monday I'm hoping to get referred to child counselor to help him deal with his anger in a more appropriate way. These tantrums are very 'angry' and triggered by the absolute smallest things, I.e. his teacher gave him a sticker he thought was for a girl. He screams at me at the top of his lungs, tells me he hates me, has hit his siblings. 
Does anyone have personal experience with this?
Any other methods I should use to deal with this tantrum? Once he's on his bed I try ignoring but he screams sooo loud!
EDIT: thanks everyone who took the time to read and respond. I plan on discussing this further with Dr tomorrow and see what she thinks and whether a therapist would be beneficial.",6
"Hey guys, first time posting at this /r since becoming a parent 2 months ago. Hi! My girlfriend and I have a 34 week preemie, with an adjusted age of around 3 weeks at this point. She is healthy and growing well, but it seems to me like my girlfriend is overcompensating for her small size and birthweight by not letting her cry for even a minute. Ever.
Whenever i hear her crying i always make sure to check her diaper, give her a bottle or ask the gf to nurse, or burp the baby. I always make sure all of her needs are met before going ok Some major googling on my part yielded no concrete results: it was split halfway between people saying to just let their babies cry for a bit  and people being appalled at the former group. I have also noticed that the baby is starting to equate being picked up to food: she would get so comfortable and warm **TL;DR is it ok to let a newborn cry for 3-4 minutes before giving her attention.**
EDIT: thank you very much for the responses everyone!""",6

We spend almost every hour of the day together, beings neither of us leave for work, only he gets up earlier then I do. Our son is in the process of being tested for autism, and hes HARD to handle. He screams atleast 6 hours a day for fits, and allot of times when hes happy. He communicates thru screaming, and can only put together short sentences, althought hes full of love. Even though hes great, its hard. My parents where heart broken when I got pregnant, but the thing is, they are his biggest fans. They live for that little boy, and I mean that. Weve lived out on our own most of his life, but recently moved back to their duplex to save up to buy a house. We never get out, its impossible to take our son anywhere (he cummunicates by screaming) and although we try, when we do we either get kicked out, or have to leave because hes having a breakdown screaming his lungs out in the middle of the floor. Its impossible for him to set in a chair for a nice dinner date, or even go to the park because the constant fits, or getting naked (he does this allot, and although he is well disciplined he still does it) and the kids outcast him. Like I said, we are trying to pinpoint whats wrong . Anyways, My parents refuse to watch him, even for a few hours a month so we can go out to dinner. I know its not their kid, but still. If we even asked its Should have kept your legs closed"" and yes, Im at my breaking point. So my question to you is how often do you go out without your children?""",6

"Hey ladies! I admit, I think karma is coming back to bite me. My son was such a great sleeper from 2 weeks on, usually sleeping 8-10 hours per night and although I knew I was lucky, I'm getting payback now! Pretty much since he turned one he has started waking up between 4:30-5am every morning and is just up for the day. He usually is in bed between 7:15-7:45 every night and we have an amazing bedtime routine that we follow very strictly (dinner, bath, storytime and bed) starting around 5:30. If we try to push him off any later and have him in bed around 8-8:30 he will wake up numerous times throughout the night and then is still up at 4:30 ready to go. I know he is still getting a good amount of sleep 9-10 hours seems about right) but it's sooooooo early!! We have tried everything we can think of. Letting him cry it out, going in and patting his back or rocking him, giving him milk (I miss the nursing days now!) and trying to let him fall back asleep and he will just scream for as long as we let him go. †Any advice on things we can try? I know some babies are early risers but this just seems cruel :) Also bonus points if you have any tips on getting him to eat anything besides pasta, cheese, Graham crackers and cheerios. He used to be an amazing eater and my husband and I cook every night (good stuff too! Nothing really boxed or canned except his damn pasta!) but he will literally throw the food on the ground or to the dogs the second we put it in front of him. Thanks in advance!!",2
"Hey ladies, sorry I'm posting on behalf of my wife because she's not a Redditor. I hope you don't mind. We're going on a ~2 week trip to a few countries with our 10 month old. She's a bit worried about breast feeding while we're away. On the one hand, he's probably old enough to stop breast feeding except for when he wakes up and before he goes to bed, but on the other hand having his food supply fresh and on hand is also very convenient. In Sydney, there are plenty of shopping centres all around the place, and they pretty much all have one or more parents' rooms, which generally have private spots for breastfeeding. We're going to a few places, such as HK and smaller towns dotted around Europe, which may not have parents' rooms. The other thing is, she's been doing a lot of pumping the last few weeks and then feeding him from the bottle later. We can take the pump with us (although it's pretty heavy), but there will be quite a few days when we're not going to be near a power point. Any tips for travelling to foreign countries with a baby and associated complications related to breastfeeding?",6
"Hey ladies. I've been thinking about taking on 2 kids in my home to help out with the bills. I lost my job a few weeks ago and am having a hard time finding something that pays enough and works with my husband and sons schedules. I've always been around kids and love taking care of them. My son is 1 and I would also love to be able to stay home with him. I have a house with a big play room and a back yard. We are planning on getting a large super yard for the backyard since it isn't totally fenced so we can play outside. Just wondering what suggestions you would have for me. Do the kids you have nap in separate rooms or together? We have a couple playpens I was planning on using. How do you do mealtime? Feed all the kids are once of feed one at a time in an area you can watch the others play. I'm also a bit concerned because we have a parrot. He is small and in his cage behind a gate when the baby is up, but I know a lot of people seem to think that all birds are sick and dirty, which is not the case. Any other advise, tips or pretty much any other comments †you can think of would be appreciated. Thanks!",6
"Hey mamas ,
My little man is 17.5 weeks old and he had a terrible bout of Bronchiolitis when he was 13 weeks old. After 10 days they FINALLY admitted him to hospital. He was in an oxygen box, being fed through an NG tube for 5 days and then we brought him home. He was still unwell but able to eat from his bottle so all good. 
He's been home for 3 weeks and he is STILL struggling with a horrendous cough, loads of fluid on his chest and very rattley breathing. All his GP says is 'bronchy babies can be ill for months or just keep contracting the virus over and again' which might be factual but doesn't help me take care of him. 
It's exhausting for all of us and I'm running out of ideas beyond, wrap up, calpol, calpol plug in thingy in his room and lots of snuggles!!",6
"Hey mamas! Does anyone have experience with this? My girl is on coconut milk and we do coconut milk yogurt (freaking YUM!). What can I sub for cheese? Vegan cheese?

She is allergic to milk...not just intolerant to lactose. I'm not super bummed about it because dairy isn't super good for you anyways. The pedi recommended soy...I'm not crazy about soy...and I think she may be allergic to that too. I'm going to get her tested for food allergies so I know what to avoid. I'm so sick of all the snot! :) Thank you for your wisdom and sharing your experience with me!",2
"Hey mommies. I'm a little confused about what to do: my 9 month old is now taking 2 great naps a day and goes to bed between 7:30-8:30. He gets solids 2-3 times a day and I nurse on demand. We give a little formula here and there, maybe a bottle during the evening because he likes to tank up before bed.
Even if he gets a big dinner and formula, he will sleep 10 hours without nursing, but ends up waking at 6 and he's starving. I'll nurse and try to lay him back down but most of the time he will only sleep for another 20-30 min, if that. Then he's up for the day.
But if he wakes at 5, he will nurse and go right back to sleep for another couple hours. 
So my dilemma is... Do I just let him wake naturally or should I wake him and nurse at like 4 or 5 so he will sleep until 7? 
Last night he went to bed at 8, I woke at 5:30 and nursed, and he slept until 7. But if I leave him alone, he will nurse too close to wake up"" time and doesn't want to go back down. He tends to sleep 11 hours at night overall. What do you think I should do? """,6
"Hey mommies. We're throwing my 8 (soon to be 9) daughters birthday in 2 weeks. This is our first big birthday with other kids. I got invitations out today, we invited her whole class (24), 4 neighborhood kids, and 3 extras. Then we have 11 family members including parents that will for sure be there.

"Hey mommit! my 3 month old daughter and I are having nap troubles, i hope you can help. Up until recently, her normal routine was awake for 1.5 hours, nap for 1.5-2 hours throughout the day. Recently, she's started waking up 45-60 minutes into her nap, crying. My first thought was 'growth spurt! she must be hungry!' NOPE, if i try to feed her, she eats for a minute or so and then goes back to crying. It seems like she wants to keep sleeping, and if I hold her, she falls back to sleep and wakes up happy and ready to eat 45-60 minutes later. My next thought was coffe, but after giving up my blessed cup in the morning, i saw no change. Some naps she's fine, some naps she needs to be held. I  feel like my options are to put her in a sling for the last half of her naps, or to let her cry it out; however, it seems like neither of these would address the reason she is waking up (not that I  know the reason she's waking up). I thought I  would tap into the mommit expertise and see if any of you had experienced the same thing, and what solutions you have. Thanks moms!
Edit: Thank you all so much for your help! Today has been a much better day. I had stopped swaddling her during naps a few weeks ago, and bringing back the swaddle helped a lot. I also took her into the pediatrician today (unrelated issue) and found out that she had gained 4 ounces in the past 5 days; girlfriend was just cranky because she was growing! She seems to be doing better with her naps already. I appreciate all the tips and help.  ",6
"Hey Mommit, I have a 7-month old who should be starting to eat non-milk foods but so far hates everything. †She was exclusively breastfed until 6 months, when we started rice cereal. †She adores that, and has no problem with the spoon. †The problem is she doesn't like anything else. †So far we've tried peas, carrots, bananas, apples, plums, sweet potatoes, and avacados. †She'll happily take a bite, make a horrible grimace, and refuse the spoon again. †I've made all her purees myself, so there's nothing in there but fruit. †I've tried mixing them with her milk and/or cereal, heating them, different times of day, everything I can think of. I know this is all new to her and she's getting used to things, but it has been a month and a half with no real improvement. †Her doctor says not to worry yet and just keep trying things while still doing milk full time. †But it seems every parent I know says their babies were wolfing down purees at this age. †Any advice? The good news is that my supply appears to have increased a bit †and the baby has regained everything he lost and then some (mostly due to the formula though †as I believe he's in a growth spurt. There is just no way my supply can keep up with him at this point. Does anyone have any real world advice for me? If my baby wants to be on my breast †should I let him stay there †as he has a milk protein sensitivity) is really helping us right now †and obviously I won't watch him go hungry. I know this is a learning process and I need to be patient and strict with my feeding/pumping/pill popping schedule  I'm just worried that it will all be for nothing.  ",2
Hey mommit. Sorry for the rant I just want to get this off my chest somewhere that my mother in law doesn't visit. So not Facebook. I have a little boy just over a year. He is a pretty good eater when I put the things he LIKES in front if him that is. I started him out on these sauce free ravioli so mess was minimal while he learned to feed himself. Seems this has now sabotaged any further effort to get him to try new things. The furthest I can get is chunky soups filled with crackers. Any time I cook something healthy for him he doesn't see it as food. Even if I eat some first and go Mmm yummy. I don't want him to be unhealthy. I keep trying but when he rejects what I tried so hard to make I get mad. its so disappointing and I feel like I just am lazy cause I caused this maybe by feeding him jarred food and then baby finger food. :( am I a bad mom? EDIT; I don't get mad at him in the hurting him sense. Just frustrated at the situation and unfortunately speak angrily about it in front of but not to him. And I mean bad mom like in feeding him. A lot of articles can make a mom feel pretty bad about what and how she feeds her babe.,1

My question is, what kind of foods and how big of a peice is ok to give him? I'm scared to death of giving him anything other than the puffs or melts because I'm scared he'll choke! I know he's totally into starting to self-feed because he grabs at anything on his tray to try to eat it. At what age did your babies start getting little pieces of food? What foods? How big or small of chunks were they? Thanks moms :-) Edit: As always, the moms come through! I so appreciate all the ideas and advice.

"Hey parents of Reddit, I need some advice. I'll start with some background info. Last year, the second semester of senior year of highschool, I was forced to tell my father that I smoke because I was unprepared for a drug test that I was unaware of. They were disappointed in me, but overall pretty understanding. My dad, who was known to be a partier, even told me that he only avoided it because he knew he would enjoy it. I am now going to college in Hawaii, which is far from my home, with the help of a scholarship which pays for 75% of my tuition.
A few weeks ago, while I was home on winter break, I decided to be honest with my mom when she asked me if I still smoke. Needless to say she was not pleased. 
She later told my dad, and then she mentioned to me that he very possibly might insist on me living at home and going to school. How can I convince my parent that I am being extremely responsible with my actions? I never smoke and drive, and only have 1 joint on me at a time which I can eat if need be. I know it sounds immature, but I really would like to continue to smoke, but at the same time I don't want them to worry about me. ",6
"Hey parents, I'm an early childhood education major. I've worked in a preschool, kindergarten and home daycare. I currently work in a non state funded daycare center and nanny for two families, one with a special needs child. I want to give you an inside view of what goes on in a daycare, and give you some tips when looking for one for your child.
First off, most of us went into this career because we care about children. It isn't glamorous and it doesn't provide a lot of money. It's pretty easy to tell the difference between someone doing it for money and someone doing it for love. We love your children. We want them to be safe and happy, and if we run or work in a quality center, we want to teach them too.
Do not put your child in a center that isn't educational. This isn't babysitting, and your child shouldn't be in front of a TV all day. As you probably all know, education starts at birth. A child's most important years are birth to three. So first off, make sure the center is educational. 

15582,Other things to make sure of:
15583,Is there a routine and schedule posted (preferably in a way children can understand)?
15584,
15585,Do children have chances to develop math, science, literacy, gross and fine motor skills?
15586,
15587,Are nutritious meals and outdoor time provided?
15588,
15589,Does the center have a comprehensive parent handbook that outlines their policies?
15590,
15591,Is the classroom multicultural? Do the staff get to know the families and children individually?
15592,
15593,Is the staff/child ratio acceptable? Where I live, for example, it is 4 infants to one teacher. You never want to see that over.
15594,
15595,Do children, especially young children, have a primary teacher/caregiver, and a consistent sub?
15596,
15597,Is everything sanitary? No obviously old and dirty toys or furniture, staff wash hands in between diaper changings, etc.
15598,
15599,Are they licensed? Please don't put your child in a center that isn't licensed. Also, you can check online (DHS in my state) to see if the center has had any issues.
15600,
15601,Do the staff call the children by their names, do they get on the floor and interact with them?
15602,
15603,Is there a discipline policy you agree with?
15604,
15605,Are you welcome to stop in any time? Make sure you do!
15606,
15607,Are there sufficient toys and materials? Can children reach them? Are they labeled?
15608,
15609,Is there a quiet spot for children to go when they are overwhelmed and need to rest?
15610,
15611,Also ask the lead teacher or administrator what education the staff have. You want people with degrees, or at least CDAs, caring for your children. Centers hire highschoolers because it is cheaper. Volunteers are great, but actual employees should have background and education regarding child development.
15612,Do they send out a newsletter?
15613,
15614,Some other things to consider:
15615,Child care workers are here to help you! If you need resources, ask us. We are in contact with pediatricians, the health department, early intervention services, therapists, etc.
15616,
15617,Non state funded daycares are not required to take children with special needs. They are probably not equipped for it. You'd be better off taking a child with special needs to some place like Head Start, where they will get the care they need.
15618,
15619,We are trying to help your child. Please work with us when for toilet training and disciplining. You have to be on board with us, and we have to be on board with you. Otherwise, children get confused.
15620,
15621,Parents are often the problem. It doesn't do your child any favors if you aren't disciplining him or her.
15622,
15623,Home and family daycares are a great option! If there is one adult working in their home with children, they can have six children, including their own. If there are two adults, there can be twelve. I personally love this atmosphere, it is very family like. Just do your research. Talk to other parents, make sure they're licensed, check online to make sure they haven't had issues.
15624,
15625,
15626,Now, if you have checked out a daycare and you feel good about it, work with the providers. Like I said, we care. Of course, we don't like every child. That's often a lack of discipline problem at home (children need rules, structure, consequences and discipline. You won't be helping them by not doing these things). But we take great care of every child and want to teach them. Some children we genuinely love, especially if they come in as infants. Sometimes we do silly things (I have gone to the bathroom with a baby on my lap because she was sick and I didn't want to put her down). We are people too. Please try to be on time, let us know what's going on at home, respect us, trust us, be interested in what's going on in class, pay on time. You are the parents, the most important people to your child. But caregivers are also very important to them, especially if children are there a lot of the time. Your child needs to bond with us too. If you've picked a quality place, we know what we're doing :)
15627,
15628,Please feel free to ask questions! Toilet training, teething, discipline strategies, how to pick a good babysitter, anything! I'm here to help.",6
"Hey r/parenting,
I just had a question for you parents out there. When is the point at which you trust your children to chew their food properly and not choke on said food? This is, literally, my greatest fear when it comes to the possibility of being a parent.

"Hi /r/mommit!
Last semester, my senior project team (on another account, we lost the password) posted a survey here asking about your strollers and how you currently deal with stairs and baby strollers. Your responses were incredibly helpful!
For our senior project, we designed a stair-capable baby stroller. Our team has now built the first iteration of the prototype. You can see the first prototype in action [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5inZOmPMsLM) and [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv6XY0YLGXE&feature=youtu.be).
23518,
23519,We are currently in discussion with one of the largest stroller manufacturers in the USA to work on licensing our idea. So, **if you're interested in our product, email us at Upsadazy@gmail.com**!
23520,Thanks so much to all of you that responded! We're students and don't have any kids so you're input was/is incredibly valuable!
23521,
23522,**EDIT:**  So to clarify, the user does not actively push the stroller up the stairs. The system is electrically driven by a 24V DC motor. If (and only if) the user is actively pushing the button, the motor turns the treads which pulls the stroller up the stairs. Else, self-locking gears prevent the treads from moving (so it won't roll down the stairs). It (our system) can handle up to 100lb on a 45 degree angle staircase. The stroller itself directly from the manufacturer is limited to 40lb. In the finalized design, the attachable system will add no more than 10 lb to the stroller. 
23523,
23524,It is statically stable, so if you let go of the stroller, currently it will not tip backwards. We're in the process of implementing the safety legs such that if extra weight is added to the back of the stroller and the user lets go of the handle, the stroller *will not tip*. ",6
"Hi /r/parenting, long time lurker looking for some advice. TL;DR at the end.
We've always bathed him at night at about 6:30, given him expressed milk from a bottle (so we could gauge how much he was getting and get him plenty full for the night - around 180ml usually), then put him down as he is falling asleep. After that he could do anything though.
Four weeks ago he got his first cold and it got really difficult. Since he has gotten better though he seems to want to feed at night every two hours (feeds can take up from 15 minutes up to an hour as he's using them to soothe as well). This has been really and depressingly consistent for a three weeks now and we feel we need to do something. He's on solids during the day and eating two relatively big meals each day. Partner is trying to breast feed more during the day but he just loses interest quickly during the day breast feeds.
So our plan is to only offer him two feeds a night. When he wakes at other times in the night we will soothe, shush, pat, cradle, rock etc - whatever it takes to get him back to sleep. We are trying to avoid controlled crying or other cry it out techniques. Partner is trying to get more feeds in during the day. Our theory is if we can get him feeding during the day he wont be hungry when he wakes during the night. Then maybe we can just stick the pacifier back in, or he'll learn to self soothe. If he only wakes for two feeds a night (11:00pm and 3:00am is our hopeful plan) we can manage ok with that.
First problem we've hit though is he will wake at 1:00am looking for a feed - then we try and soothe him without a feed for two hours but he just wont go back to sleep. Then he finally gets a feed at 3:00 and goes back to sleep. So while we're trying to get him used to two feeds a night he's sleeping less at night and more during the day as a result. Feeling a bit trapped, if we fix his feeding we ruin his sleep even more. If we don't fix his feeding sleep will never get better.
Any advice /r/parenting? Other than the sleeping he is a happy baby, putting on weight regularly and at an expected rate.
We've only done two nights of this new plan, we're both very tired as a result and not sure what he'll do next.
TL;DR - Baby goes to sleep at night quite easily but then wakes every two hours for a feed. Changing his feeding pattern seems to be making him completely nocturnal. Not sure what to do.",6
"Hi /r/parenting,
We've recently moved from Pennsylvania to Massachusetts and are having some problems getting our 21 month old son back into the swing of things with daycare after a +/-6 week hiatus from it.
Our son had been going to a KinderCare in Pennsylvania from age 3 months to 19 months with few if any issues. In fact, by the time he reached the early toddler room at 15 months old he was really thriving and looked forward to going.
We moved to Massachusetts in November and decided to keep him home until after the New Year because KinderCare does not discount their weekly rate for holidays that fall during the week.
We started him at a new KinderCare in MA a few weeks ago and it has gotten to the point now where he starts screaming, sobbing, and actively resisting removal from his car seat when he arrives at the center, all of which are new behaviors both in the context of day care drop off as well as in general.
Of course, things are a little bit different with now than before so we're trying to figure out how we can go about testing"" the cause of his consternation without causing him so much misery. Here's the rundown of all the things that we *think* might be causing his outbursts upon arrival to day care:
1. **Change in dropoff routine**: Previously I was the one who dropped him off and picked him up from day care however now my wife is taking on that responsibility.
2. **Change in age group**: Previously he was the oldest child in the early toddler group and now he is by far the youngest (though most verbal) in the older toddler group.
3. **Change in class size**: Previously he was in a group of 3-5 children with one teacher and now he is in a group of 8-10 children with two teachers.
4. **Change in physical location**: Obviously he was very acclimated to his old center whereas the current center is brand new to him.
5. **Change in schedule**: Previously he was going to day care 3-4 days/week depending on my wife's work schedule (she had the ability to work from home 1-2 days/week) whereas now he only goes 2 days/week.
6. **Change in diet/nutrition**: At our old center we supplied all of his meals and snacks but at the new center we are forbidden from doing so. He must eat the meals and snacks provided by the center
7. **Intangibles**: There are obviously other differences and these are the ones we're most concerned about. Could it be that he's not being treated as nicely by the staff? Could it be that he doesn't get along with the other children? Could it be that this center
So  what approach might you all suggest to try to figure out the root cause of his sudden apprehension about going to daycare? If you have similar experiences I invite you to share what you did to try to address the situation.""",6
"Hi All!  First time mom here and need a bit of advice.  I have a 5.5 month old daughter that I rock to sleep for her naps and at bedtime.  If she wakes up at night I feed her and she falls asleep on the boob.  Every once in a while she'll fall asleep in her stroller or car seat if we are walking/driving.  She sleeps in her crib.  I'm just wondering how do u get ur child to fall asleep?  I'm not against rocking it's just that she often wakes up when I transfer her from my arms to the crib which means we r back to rocking again...and sometimes this goes on for 3 to 4 times. I'm not really into CIO and kinda hoping that eventually she'll learn how to fall asleep on her own?? I tried to put her down drowsy (like a lot of the books suggest) but it results in her getting upset n crying so I end up picking her up and rocking anyways. She's also getting quite heavy at 19lbs so I'm thinking soon I'll have a really hard time rocking her...

"Hi All! I'm 12 weeks pregnant with #3 and we're pretty much keeping everything to ourselves until after my next appointment. With my first two pregnancies I never experienced any issue with NOT being able to eat anything, but the last few weeks have been rough on my stomach. The smell of pork, chicken, ground beef, and ground turkey set my stomach off and the texture of raw meat or even lunch meats. I quickly prepare meals when I have to touch raw meat and then have to take a breather to pull myself back together. I have managed to eat pork sausage (I made sausage gravy and biscuits the other day) and I ate a chicken (patty) sandwich from a fast food place last week too. For the most part, I've been eating multi-grain cheerios, yogurt and soups with crackers. I know this may come to pass and I'm not hurting myself or #3, but I'm hoping for any tips, tricks, or recipes to help sub for the lack of protein from anyone who has gone through something similar. †",6
"Hi All!
29846,
29847,
29848,My formula fed identical twin girls are having a hell of a time drinking from bottles lately. We use Dr. Brown bottles, level 3 nipples. We've tried moving up to level 4 nipples but they seem too fast at this point.
29849,
29850,
29851,Anyway, over the last few weeks getting them to finish after about two or thee ounces (rather than five to six as normal) has been murder. They scream and reject the nipples. This seems to happen at all different times of day (except the occasional night feeding - 8 month sleep regression sucks) and regardless of when they have eaten solid foods. It happens regardless of stomach troubles (they have recently gotten over a stomach bug). It happens regardless if both twins are eating at the same time or being fed one after the other. They are both at different stages of teething (one has two bottom teeth, the other no teeth).
29852,
29853,Things we've tried that haven't made a difference:
29854,
29855,
29856,1. Sitting them up so they can see what's going on around them.
29857,
29858,2. Teaching them to hold their own bottles (not so much).
29859,
29860,3. Feeding in the quietest environment as possible.
29861,
29862,4. Eliminating one of their solid food meals (lunch) and reducing solids at breakfast and dinner.
29863,
29864,5. Sippy cups - not getting the idea quite yet
29865,
29866,
29867,Two things that kind of work - forcing them to take the nipple (they cry and I wait, then put the nipple back in their mouths until they take it), or distracting them by letting them play with my face/hair/mouth. Their nana (who watches them during the day) hates forcing them and their father hates the distraction technique (they pull his facial hair).
29868,
29869,Can anyone think of other things to try? Any advise or war stories to help me get through this? Thanks!!",6
"Hi all, hope this is the correct place for this.
I've been dating this women for coming up to a year now. She has a two children, one who is 12 years old the other is 8. The parents break up is 2 years old now and went through without any hassle. They both still speak and do what they can for the children.
Over the past 6 months the childs behaviour has become almost unbearable. I understand that growing up can be hard, body changing and I have no issues which how a normal 12 year old would act, the issue comes when they do things you don't expect.
In the Kitchen my partner kept a money/piggy bank, had about ¬£200 in it. The other month she noticed it had moved, took it down and saw the top was broken, all ¬£200 was missing. We found about ¬£50 of it under her bed with ¬£150 missing/spent.
We sat down with her and tried to talk to her but all she did was get agressive, start crying and blaming the other child. Due to work and lifestyle I do not life with my partner yet and only see her about 2/3 times a week if that and I can tell my partner is struggling and she won't let me punish the child. 
Over the past few months if money is being left around she will take it, if you leave your purse/wallet out she will take money from it. On Thursday she went to down, her Mum asked how much money she had and she wouldn't show her Mum. Finds out she stole ¬£10 from her purse earlier. 
They are currently on holiday at the moment and their Dad both gave the kids ¬£20 to spend, found out today that the oldest stole money from the youngest, even while on holiday.
One of the issues I find is the Mum isn't good at controlling her, I find she just screams and shouts because she is so annoyed at the situation. I also find she still spoils the kid, why give the kid anything nice when it steals from you, lies about it and laughs in your face.
I'm beginning to loose patience in the relationship but I when I go over or stay over I never leave my wallet out of site, that is a horrible relationship.
The child also lies about everything, steals food from the fridge too and denies it even if you see her eating it or find wrappers in her room.
Running out of ideas, the ideas I have my partner does not seem to like. I suggested get a PSCO over and do some scare tactics.
Any advice greatfully received! 
Thanks
TLDR: Kid lying, stealing food/money, no remorse.

"Hi all,
I have 2 kids 8 and 6.  They are my little lovely girls!  My wife just recently found a job where as previously she would stay at home.  This has changed our routine drastically.  While the extra income is sweet we now have less face time with our kids.  The routing is - pick them up from daycare, get their homework done, cook dinner, eat dinner, clean dinner.  While my wife and I are getting stuff ready my kids are plopped in front of the TV or playing their nintendo DSs.  Not the best thing in the world.  What things have you parents done to get your kids interested in other things besides the TV? Any tips?  ",6
"Hi all,
I know this is never a substitution for a professional medical opinion, and we'll absolutely be calling tomorrow to get an appointment to see the pediatrician, but in the meantime I was just wondering if anyone could offer some insight or anecdotes so I can try and figure out what's wrong (if anything?) with my son these days.
He's 4 months old now, and he used to sleep soundly through the night, aside from nudging my wife awake a few times for a feed (we co-sleep). Since a bit more than a week now he'll suddenly wake up in the night screaming as if he's in pain. He feels really stiff - if you hold him he can be comforted out of it and will eventually fall asleep again, after maybe 5 - 10 minutes. The same thing will happen even when he's awake, and it doesn't happen super often - maybe 3 - 5 times in the night, if that, and around 3 times during the day, if that.
He's drooling like hell and mashing his fists into his mouth like crazy these days so I'm guessing a tooth should be making its appearance soon, but could this random stiffness and waking up potentially be related to teething? I've read sites saying that no We don't want to feel like we're missing the symptoms of something really serious here - aside from this he's a healthy happy guy - good appetite

"Hi all,
In the UK we don't really do 'push presents,' at least it's not an expected thing, but I was really impressed with my wife throughout the pregnancy and a difficult labour and it's been my intention to buy her something as a token of my appreciation for how incredible she's been throughout it all.
I initially thought of something like a necklace with the baby's birthday engraved on it or something along those lines or else a really good compact camera so she doesn't have to lug her big heavy dSLR with her any time she wants to take some photos of the baby and maybe I'll still get her one or both of these gifts but over the last week I've noticed her say the same thing an awful lot. She will comment along the lines of 'my identity has totally changed, I'm not who I was any more, I'm now just baby's food machine.'
First off, I'd like to say that she doesn't seem depressed or sad about any of this, just that she is aware of how her life now rotates around breastfeeding, so I was wondering if anyone could let me know of a good gift that would remind her I haven't forgotten all her old qualities or something to give her back a bit of her old identity. Perfume is the first thing that comes to mind but maybe that's a bit obvious. Anyway, let me know if you can think of anything!

"Hi all,
My 3 year old (36lbs) has been struggling with night terrors for the past year. Lately it has become more frequent (nearly every night) and lasting longer than usual. I talked to our doctor about it who basically said it was normal and brushed it off. Today I went to the health food store and the clerk recommended my daughter take 1/4tsp of magnesium powder mixed in a drink right before bed. She seemed slightly sketchy about the exact dosage, so I'm wondering if any of you have tried it? How much did you give? Did you see results?? ",6
"Hi all. My 2 year old still loves to nurse pretty regularly. We have such a tough time with solid foods though. She likes very few foods and even with those foods it's very unreliable whether she'll eat them at any given meal. She just doesn't seem interested in eating. I don't think it's a sensory issue because the foods she likes have varying textures. I'm really afraid of setting her up for long lasting bad habits in a few regards: 1. OFFERING TOO MANY CHOICES: What we tend to do at meal time is sit her in her highchair and keep offering more and more and more choices til we finally find the magic set of things she'll eat at that meal. Some people say that's a horrible habit to get into and we should just give her a set meal and she can either eat it or not and she'll eventually learn to eat what we give her. And on the opposite side some people say: Feed your kids whenever they're hungry -- not just meal times... And let them eat wherever in the house... And present lots of choices and make it fun with food on toothpicks or in muffin tins or in toy cars rolling across the floor. ;-) I have no idea what approach to take. 2. NOT HEALTHY ENOUGH CHOICES AND NOT MUCH VARIETY: She doesn't eat a single vegetable. We sneak them into fruit smoothies when we can get her to have one of those. The only foods she'll eat are cheese, yogurt, fruit, buttered whole wheat toast, sliced turkey or some beef meatballs but none of those reliably. She's extremely reluctant to try anything new. I'm afraid I'm setting her up to like nothing but sweet, salty, fatty foods. (She loves sweets, hot dogs and pizza too but we make sure to make that a very rare special treat when we're out or something.) 3. BETWEEN MEAL SNACKING: If we're on the go"" somewhere she'll often ask to have a snack of goldfish or something similar in the car or stroller. Could that be causing a problem? I wonder. I'd love to have some advice from others! I'm not sure if I should just ""do my best and she'll grow out of it"" or if I'm setting her up for deeply ingrained bad eating habits for life! She's on the small end things size-wise but her doctor's not worried at all and neither are we. We're just worried about setting good eating habits. Thanks for any thoughts or tips or even just commiseration! :-)""",2
"Hi everyone! 
I don't know what the protocol for this is, so I'm just gonna introduce myself. I'm Battlestarbean, and I gave birth to a awesome little human being named Henry just under two weeks ago via cesarean section due to a fibroid blocking his way out. So far it's been...pretty interesting. I'm actually recovering from the c-section pretty well, been up and moving around with no complications basically since we've been home from the hospital. Actually, I've been doing so well I'm starting to get antsy. Henry's still young enough that all he really does is eat and sleep and poop and as much as I love him,  staying in the house with him is a little boring.

"Hi everyone!

I have a 5.5 month old daughter.  She had been pretty good at sleeping though the night.  She would be fussy when we put her to bed, but would usually sleep 6-8 hours at a time, wake up once to eat, then sleep for a few more hours.  She even slept 11 hours straight once.  
We had been putting her to sleep in the crib in her nursery, but if she ate in the middle of the night, I‚Äôd feed her in my bed and put her in the cosleeper next to the bed for the rest of the night.  (She‚Äôs breastfed, but we‚Äôre introducing solids.)

But now I need help!  For the past week, she‚Äôs been waking up at least every 1.5 - 2 hours.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if she‚Äôs in the crib, the cosleeper, or our bed.  Most of the time she would need to nurse to get back to sleep (only to wake up 2 hours later), but sometimes she was content to sleep between my husband and me and get snuggles.  

Last night was the worst.  She would shriek at the top of her lungs unless she had my nipple in her mouth.  After I gave in to what she wanted, I actually got some sleep because she could just eat when she wanted to without waking me up.  But I don‚Äôt like sleeping the whole night with her in bed with us. 

Any advice?  We don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs changed with her. And we need a plan to fix it.",6

"Hi everyone, wondering a few things about feeding my 10 month old. 1. How do you feed 3 meals a day plus bottles when a nap schedule is unpredictable? Some days she is up early and may nap 10:30-12, 3:30- 4:30. Most days lately she refuses and fights naps until almost 12 and then sleeps until 2 or 3. I don't understand how to fit in my 3 meals with this schedule. 2. What sources of protein should I feed her? An example meal we have is eggs, diced veggies or puree and some multi grain cheerios. Her main sources of protein are eggs, plain full fat yogurt, formula and a little bit of peanut butter or cheese here and there. 3. She falls asleep while drinking a bottle in her rocker, then she is moved to her crib while still asleep. Im concerned she will have problems because I am not brushing her teeth after the bottle. It often takes hours to get her to sleep at night, so I haven't wanted to risk waking her up. We have been using teeth wipes after meals and a practice silicone massaging baby toothbrush. Is that enough? Does she need toothpaste?",2
"Hi Everyone,
I was hoping to get some wise internet advice from this subreddit about my little brother.
I'm 23 and grew up in the stereotypical divorced parents with some abuse issues home. I've turned out pretty well... ( On my way to medical school woop woop!) but I've also had many troubled times. But now, I'm really frightened by my little brother who is eight and being raised by my father and stepmother. I don't want him to make the same mistakes I did.
First off, it's my Stepmothers first child and she's a stay at home mother. Overall, it means her life is 89% what he wants her to do. It's great to see for the most part; I don't think I've seen a child so close to his mother. On the flip side though, she may be too interested and causing harm to him growing some. The brother rarely does anything for himself... We're talking breakfast in bed every day, drink refills when he taps his cup ( what the hell), and such horrible manners I sometimes just have to walk away.
It's really weird.. I can get him extremely interested in things like science, math, books, and music.. yet he always goes back to his old habits of being catered to by his mother. It's sports, friends, and video games. I believe his mother is under the impression that school is where the education happens and that an eight year old shouldn't really have homework.
The other week when I was visiting I tried to do homework with him. He absolutely loathed it saying I was too hard on him wanting him to spell words correctly. That writing neatly enough for himself to understand was not required at his age. He concluded everything by saying that all he needs is a 70 and anything he doesn't get a 70 on he can retake and mom will help. His mom ended up telling me to leave him alone because he complained.
I'm scared for the little guy and want to try and help. I'm glad he can serve a tennis ball like a 16 year old, but I think he needs to be able to do other things too.
Any suggestions on how I can help without threatening the mother-son relationship?

The first few weeks it was hard to get housework done as well as work out what the baby wanted, and I think my hubby assumed this meant I needed help. Somehow this lead to a discussion between him and his mother (I wasn't really involved) about how perhaps she could come over and help a couple of days a week.

"Hi ladies, you all have been so wonderful in the past with advice-dispensing, I hope you can be as helpful this time. I'm really out of ideas now, having tried my last one this morning, to no avail. My three month old son HATES the car. This is particularly troublesome as he needs to be in it for about an hour and a half a day as he goes to work with me (lucky me!). He cries the WHOLE TIME. I promise you, it's nothing I'm doing wrong. He's strapped properly (snugly but not tightly) into the car seat. He loves the car seat... it's one that clicks into the frame base of the stroller, and he loves the stroller. He doesn't even mind going from stroller to car, but once the car starts moving, the screaming starts. If someone sits back there with him, he screams anyway. He's not too cold, or too hot. We've ruled that out. There's a mirror in the backseat so I can keep an eye on him, and he's made eye-contact with me, albeit accidental, perhaps. Screaming the whole time. Hanging a little friend (who was once hanging in his crib) from the mirror didn't help. I've spoken to him non-stop the whole trip. Didn't help. Music didn't help. And today, I put a newly purchased arch across the car seat, it has all kinds of adorable things on it. He was totally enamored with it when he was in the stroller, but once he was in the car, forget it. Although, the rattle/crinkle stuff made him temporarily forget to cry at points in the trip. I always make sure he's freshly fed and changed before taking him anywhere, so it's not that he's hungry or dirty. I'm just stumped. :( Is this normal? Will he grow out of it?

"Hi Mamas! Has anyone else experienced their baby suddenly being hyper-attached around 9 or 10 months?I was warned this is about the time stranger danger starts where she doesn't want other people near her and will seek out Mama instead. But that's not really what mine's doing. She's fine with other people/out in public. She hasn't even pitched a fit when left with the baby sitter yet (though admittedly that's only every couple weeks). But all the sudden I can't be out of her sight when we're home alone. Not for a second. The distance I can be from her is decreasing and not even times that used to be a lock for distracting her seem to work anymore. Like when she eats and I use the time to get kitchen work done (within earshot but not sight). Complete meltdown every time I step out of her sight, even if just a second to get her more food. She just wants mama all the time. If she's in the floor playing I have to be in the floor playing. If she's hungry and I have to go make a bottle she flips until I come back. It's making it impossible to get anything done during the day- and her Dad works 60-80+ hours a week so I really am the one to get stuff done at home.
We had company this weekend and I was definitely getting a vibe- a This is what happens when the mom stays at home and always reacts to her baby's cries and knows how to self-sooth from using the pause method and a sleep routine. Anyways I'm rambling now.... I can answer questions if I've left out any pertinent details. What say you",6
"Hi mommies.....I need some advice. My 13 month old daughter is HEAVY into mommy right now.....wants nothing to do with my husband when I'm around (will actually cry hysterically if he tries to pic her up) not only is it hurting his feelings big-time (he knows it's a phase, but still, it hurts) it's difficult for me to get things done (example: tonight, he came home...I had to prep for dinner and it was a nightmare since she wouldn't let me be for a minute. I wound up ignoring her and allowing her to cry on the kitchen floor until her dinner was ready...super big guilt :( I'm not sure why she's so suddenly attached to me....we both spend equal time with her (I work 9-8 on Saturdays, so he's with her all day. We are both here Sundays, I have her Monday and Tuesdays. She's with a sitter from 9-5:45 Wednesday-Friday and my husband has her from 6-8, until her bedtime. incidentally, she will always choose her baby-sitter over us any day of the week) I suppose there's no real solution....I guess I just needed to vent and reach out to others in the same position. I just feel so badly for my husband because he simply adores her. ",6
"Hi Mommit! Hoping you can offer some advice. My one year old has been a pretty good eater of purees and has eaten well with her hands for months. Once she turned one we transitioned to whole milk and finger foods. The only purees I feed her now are yogurt or applesauce. She did pretty well at first but for the last week or so doesn't want to eat anything I give her, except for scrambled eggs, frozen pieces of some fruits and veg and puffs. She throws everything else on the floor. I've given her a variety of things ( waffles, toast, quesadilla, pb&j, pasta, lasagna, pieces of turkey, chicken and ham, all sorts of fruit and veg. She used to eat most of it, but this past week she won't eat anything. Or maybe a bit then throws it on the floor. She has no fever and drinks the milk and a ton of water just fine and normal pee/poo. Is she showing me her defiance? I will only give her one food at a time to let her know that this is what she will eat, and will put it back on her tray if she throws it off ( my floor is clean and I don't care). Meal times can last almost an hour. I am in tears most days because of this and feel like I am failing as a mom. If any of you have been in a similar situation please let me know! Thanks you!",6
"Hi mommit! I come to you with a question about 11 month olds and felines. My daughter likes to feed the cat. During mealtimes. By dropping her food on the floor from her high chair. I only have one idea for a solution: lock up the cat during mealtimes. Does anyone else have experience with something similar? I feel bad for the cat because he's not doing anything bad, and locking him up feels like I am punishing him. I don't want to tell the baby No!"" and risk her developing a negative association with food. Any advice? Right now I am trying to stop her mid-drop by asking her ""Can you put the banana on the tray?"" and it works about 2 out of 3 times. Thanks in advance",6
"Hi Mommit! I have a 13 month old who was always a good sleeper until recently. She's been waking up crying like something is scaring her each night, and seems tired and clingy during the day due to the missing sleep. She used to sleep great between 7:30-8 a.m., but it's anybody's guess these days when she's going to wake in the night, but it usually happens. She seems afraid lately, and was wondering if anyone else has had to use a night light for such a young child (I read it's typically about 18+ months the fear of the dark begins), and if it worked? I'm going to try it, but would like some input, too. Also I'm wondering if the bedtime routine should be adjusted. Now she has dinner at 6, light playtime with Daddy at 6:30, bath at 7 every other evening, bottle at 7:30, a little bit of snuggle/rocking time, followed by bed. She still goes to bed fine, just wakes. Also she has been down to one nap since 11 months. She typically naps from 12:45-3ish. I'm surviving through the lost sleep but she's very sleepy, my main concern. Thanks for any help, moms! I'm so glad I have such a great community of INTELLIGENT, thoughtful moms (and dads) from whom I've learned such a great deal through the last year! :D",6
"Hi mommit! I have a 14.5 month old and I'm starting to think it's about time to take her off the milk bottle. I tried cold turkey on Monday, and while she still demanded her before-bed bottle (I gave in easily because I'm sure it's hard for her), but the last couple of days without her 3 bottles, she really wasn't drinking enough liquid (very few diaper changes). I offered her a sippy with milk at meal times, and had a water or juice sippy available to all day, which I offered her frequently. She would take a few sips and be done. I gave her a before-bed bottle last night just because it guaranteed she'd get SOME fluids but other than that she would just turn them down. She's always had a small juice sippy and water the rest of the day and has done just fine and drank a lot. I'm about to give in and just reinstate her bottles today because I was always dehydrated when I was little and would really like to avoid that with her. Do you guys have any suggestions to get her to drink more? I'm at a loss. Thank you!!*edited for typos†",2
"Hi mommit! I was wondering if anyone had any advice they might be willing to share about my current situation! My 18 month old daughter threw up for the first time ever last night. (I mean, she's spit up before, but this was our first knock-down, drag-out pukefest.) She threw up twice, then I tried to give her some water and she puked that right up too. Honestly I'm not super concerned about her health, she's a very healthy girl and it seems like it was probably just a bug - she never had a fever and she woke up this morning in great spirits. She ate breakfast and drank some water and they've both stayed down so far. My question is if anyone has experienced anything like this before! Is there a chance it worked its way out of her system as quickly as it came? I just don't want to attempt to take her to Thanksgiving dinner at my in-laws' if it's not over yet. I don't mind staying home with her, but I know my husband would be devastated (but supportive of course!) She's my first baby, and I didn't realize how little I knew about toddler puke until I was knee deep in it. Thanks for any advice or anecdotes or information you might have, and happy Thanksgiving!",6
"Hi Mommit! I've done a quick search and couldn't find anything relevant so I apologise if this has been asked ad nauseam. My 9 month old has hit a couple of milestones in the past 2 weeks or so, first tooth, crawling, words, clapping. It's been intense! I'm guessing it's also bought about the change in his eating habits. I weaned traditionally - he was happy to be spoon fed until just a few days ago. Now he has major meltdowns if I go anywhere near him with a spoon. He was eating 3-4 190g jars of food a day along with formula. He's been at the 98th centile since birth. He will eat finger foods - fruit, toast, fish fingers and carrots have all been hits. It's just how little he has has me worried. Most ends up on the floor. I think spoon feeding was my security blanket, I knew it was going in and he was having enough to eat, being forced to go baby led has completely thrown me off track. I'm so stressed out it's effecting my sleep..I'm constantly worried he hasn't had enough to eat. Any tips, advice or reassurance would be most welcome, cause right now I feel like the worst mum in the world! Edit : Thank you Mommit!†",2
"Hi Mommit! My daughter just turned 2 this month, but this has been an on-going issue for several months (maybe even a year). I spoke with her doctor about it, who reassured me that if she's hungry she'll eat, which I do believe is true. However, this girl is very headstrong (she comes about it honestly...guilty as charged) and if it's a food she doesn't immediately recognize she will NOT try it. At this point she eats waffles, toast, scrambled eggs, ham, SOME chicken, cheese, applesauce, yogurt, bananas (sometimes), macaroni and cheese, and canned fruit (she used to eat all kinds of good fresh fruit, but no more). The only veggie she'll eat is corn and that's basically just sugar. I'm crawling out of my SKIN! Her doctor advised me to cook how I normally do and do not make her anything special. But as soon as I put her food in front of her, she'll wave it away and throw a HUGE tantrum, so I calmly will get her out of her high chair and put her down and she goes about her merry way. She's figured out if she drinks a lot of milk it'll fill up her stomach, too. Oh, and yesterday I gave her one of those little organic squeeze fruit pouches while we were shopping as she was hungry (and, of course, hadn't eaten lunch), and now she wants babyfood all the time. She's not teething because she has all her teeth. HELP! I want her to eat a variety of foods, and I'm not into being a short-order cook! Obviously I know when she's 6 years old she won't do this anymore, but pleeeeaaaaase, how can I get her to just TRY things?!? FYI She doesn't care if I'm eating it. Tried it. Thank you for any responses, even if it's just Oh",6
"Hi Mommit! Your opinions are (usually) of great value to me. I hope I can receive some helpful advice. My boy just turned one, he has been weaned from the bottle for 2 months, he eats pureed/baby food like a CHAMP. His pediatrician told me 'no more baby food, he should eat what you eat.' Easier said than done... He will only eat crackers and cookies. I have tried; cheese, noodles, rice, meats, greenbeans, avocado, potatoes, pancakes, toast, and so much more! He is not interested. I always end up spoon feeding him something I puree with milk/baby cereal mixed in :( Anyone else have this problem. Will it just click one day? What am I doing wrong? I don't want any sympathy  I'm okay. We just need to pass it on to others",2
"Hi Mommit!
For a long while myself and other parents at my work have been working on a kids app to help with tracking food groups, staying hydrated, and teaching them how that relates to their mood. 
For me keeping track and communicating with my husband on what food groups our daughter has had doesn't come as naturally as I want it to.   
The App is called Muncher Jr. and it's only currently only available in the iOS store, but we will be making one for the google play store as well.
I'm currently working on adding an activity section to encourage kids to be active and exercise.
Would you be willing to check it out? Give me your feed back in what is and isn't helpful?

"Hi mommit, I am a SAHM. Starting this month I am going back to school two days a week and my daughter is going to a Parent's Day Out program. I am so nervous. For over a year now she has spent almost every single day with me. Anyway, I have to send a lunch with her that is ready to eat, and it can't be heated or refrigerated. At home we usually just eat what is left over from dinner the night before and maybe a sandwich. Any suggestions? †She has no allergies, but the school is peanut free.†",4
"Hi Mommit, my son is almost six month old and soon will be starting on solids. I really want to do BLW but am at a bit of a loss as to where to start. We eat really well but a lot of what we eat is saucy food, i.e. curries or tomato pasta sauce. We eat rice and rice pasta primarily for starches as I have a gluten intolerance. And dairy. And egg. Sigh. My question is since the baby is supposed to eat what we eat, how do I adapt our menu? And how do you handle meat?? Have any of you done BLW and if so how did you get started? I get as far as thinking I'd like his first food to be avocado and after that I'm kind of stumped. Purees seem easier but it's not what I want to do! Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. :)",2
"Hi Mommit, this is a bit of a long one so please bear with me, 

My sister has a two month old (Joan) and is having a really difficult time adjusting to motherhood; from lack of sleep, and a bunch of troubles since (including yeast infections, colds, reflux, and apparently the feed times are taking 1.5 hours). She is about to see a lactation consultant for the slow feed times, but other than that she seems so exhausted when I talk to her -- it's heartbreaking.   
  
Currently I live overseas and have yet to meet Joan but I will be back for Christmas. My mother died quite some years ago, and our extended family is a bit of a mess, so my sister doesn't really have much of a maternal figure to help guide her along the way.   

When I'm back for Christmas I'd like to try and help my sister as much as I can so she can have naps, rest, and recoup during the holidays (and to try and fill the void of not having our mom there to help her out); however I don't really know of any resources, tips or things that I can do to *really* help my sister out (aside from maybe making her and her husband meals, tidying up their house, and offering to do late night feeds).    

Anyways, I'd appreciate hearing what kinds of things your family members and friends did -- which really helped you out when things were tough. 

**tl;dr:** what are some essential things that I can do to help my sister get rest, and recoup?    
 
**edit 1**: Thanks so much for all of your input everyone! This Christmas is going to kick some butt for my sister, myself, and the little one.

"Hi Mommit, this is a question about home organization, but I thought mommies could answer it best... what kind of boxes do you use for storing food and sending lunch in?

"Hi mommit. I'm about to go fucking insane so if this post has errors please forgive me.
My husband has never helped me with our baby (5 mos). At first I let it slide because I was exclusively breastfeeding and on maternity leave but it's just gotten ridiculous.
He literally won't do ANYTHING. Never mind the big stuff, like getting up at night, bath time, etc., but he also won't change diapers, drop her off at daycare, hold her so I can eat dinner/breakfast. If we're out somewhere and she starts crying I am ALWAYS the one who goes outside to calm her. 
He's also wildly inconsiderate. I work long hours and my job requires me to be outside all day so I come home from work absolutely exhausted and hungry and he'll just hand her to me. Usually he 'needs' to go seine where too, so I don't even have time to change out of my work clothes.
All of this is REALLY starting to get to me, and the kicker is that he acts this way and then gets all confused when I have a short temper with him or when I'm too tired to be intimate. I've tried to talk to him about his behavior and he promised me he would change but so far I've seen zero improvement. Help me!!",6
"Hi moms of reddit. My little girl just turned a year old yesterday. Hallelujah we made it! Anyway, a few weeks ago we were on a great feeding schedule and she would eat all kinds of lovely finger foods: peas, carrots, bananas, cheeses, little meats, etc, and I would offer a nice variety at meal time. And for the most part shed eat it all. She never turned anything down! Well, at 11.5 months we started weaning her from soy formula to soy milk (dr recommended). Well she either got a stomach bug or had a reaction to the milk and got diarrhea for a day. We put her back on the formula immediately and were going to wait til she was regular and try whole milk (I never really thought she was lactose sensitive to begin with and doubted the soy milk...wish I would've listened to my gut!). Since she's been back on formula (about 5 days), she will hardly touch normal food! She'll only eat bananas and applesauce. She shoves everything else away without even a taste. Her dad can sometimes get her to at least try some things, but like today, she just opened her mouth and let the pea fall out. And peas were her favorites! I know she's hungry because shell just wolf down her bottle. I'm wondering if she's just preferring filling up on the formula and it'll stop once she's on milk and not getting as much, but I'm so frustrated, she's frustrated, and I'm at my wits end. Her 12-month appointment is Tuesday so I will talk to her doctor about it then, but has anyone else got any insight as to how to get her to eat like she used to?? I miss being spoiled and able to enjoy my own meal as well!",1
"Hi moms! Go easy on me, this is my first ever post. I have a question for you moms. We were given the all clear to start solids for my 6 month old boy. Exciting time for sure! He adores his high chair, and seems to love to be in it, and is liking all the foods we throw at him. :) I'm finding however, emotionally I'm having a hard time dealing with him taking solids. I do breastfeed him all the time, and in the beginning, it was so incredibly difficult. I'm proud that we overcame our obstacles, and have been able to continue to breastfeed-but watching him eat, just breaks my heart. I know I can't breastfeed him forever, and I know that he will start rejecting foods later on if we don't start him on solids now. I am also aware that after a year, the medical benefits of breastfeeding don't necessarily apply. I'm cool with that. I also know he is genuinely interested in food, and I want to encourage him, but I am just struggling emotionally to see him eat other foods than my breast milk. Am I alone? Any wisdom words? Has any other mom gone through something similar? Please help!†",6

I realize that all babies grow at different rates and all that stuff  but in the meantime  should I worry?

"Hi Mums and dad...
Aussie husband here... 32 years old and father 2 two daughters, 1 2 year old and 1 5 month old.
Yeah - doing the whole 2 under 2 thing... and its CRAZY
But I wanted some advice if possible.
While we have a 2 year old, meaning we've been parents for 2 years... we still find lots of thigns very new. For example... Gastro (Do americans call it that?) or basically a stomach bug that gives them runny nappies and makes them vomit.
My 2 year old got it last week and was a champ. Pretty grumpy, wouldnt eat - spewed only once, had the runs a bit... but was over and done with in a few days.
but... of course, our 5 month old daughter got it and the poor little thing is taking it a bit harder.
My wife and I, bless her... she's upstairs asleep as we're on shift work now... but we're just a bit frustrated.Our daughters is 5 months old and has always been very needy. We think she has reflux and has always been a very demanding baby... so life has been tough.
Anyway... on Monday she came down with runny nappies and was general irratable. Fine.
Then on Wednesday, Spew... 3-4 times... then Thursday, a couple of times... and today (We're in Australia), Friday... only once so far.
The nappies are also getting a bit thicker...
She is formula fed, a reflux formula... and would probably drink about 800-1000ml of formula a day/24 hours.
Anyway... she hasn't eaten today for over 10 hours... although she did have a good morning where over the course of the morning, she drank about 350ml
She's very gassy/farty/burpy... but yeah, we just want her to start feeding again.
We took her to hospital and the doctors virtually said not to worry... if she starts getting dehydrated (they gave us signs, sunken eyes, lethargy etc) than come back... but otherwise, just push through. So yeah - we're massivly, massively sleep deprived... but just wanting our little one to start eating. I'm not sure if a 1/3 of her usual intake while having a bug is good... perhaps I'm being impatient... but yeah, its new to us.
Sorry for the long post... if any of you super dooper expirienced moms can just give some advice it would be great.
She's so happy, smiling, poking her tongue out and playing... just every now and then a bit grumpy and not eating!!
Thanks for listening guys",6
"Hi mums!
I'm a FTM, my son was born 7 days ago and is on the whole a really cruisey newborn but the second night after we bought him home he was inconsolable from about 3pm - 2am with what we suspect was wind pain? He also had a very high number of loose stools the next day (with resulting nappy rash i feel awful about) so im questioning whether i sterilised his bottle of EBM properly as well which may have caused him to be unsettled. That night and the helplessness i felt as a mother has left me feeling very anxious now as night approaches, i know it is inevitable and tbat we have more rough nights ahead of us, but this anxiety is crippling me! Im terrified my son is suffering wind and is going to be colicky and the fact that he doesnt always burp after feeds (breastfed 99%) has me double guessing if he is in fact windy or just doesnt always need to burp? Plus his nappy rash doesnt seem to be getting any better or worse. Hes changed after every feed so about every 2 hours and im using plenty of sudocream. I realise a lot of this is probably related to my hormones and im not really sure where im going with this post...",6
"Hi my fellow redditor parents. 
My wife and I just had our first, a beautiful baby girl. She is altogether lovely. However, she shrieks. I'm talking banshee-curdle-the-blood-in-your-soul shrieks. She does it a lot, too. After feeding, after diaper changing, while rocking, while swaddled, etc. All the time. 
I know she's probably hungry (we juuuuust had her) and she's adjusting to life not inside a cozy uterus. But, it's overwhelming thinking of her doing this for the next couple of months.

"Hi Parenting! I'm new to this group as my daughter was just born 6 days ago. My pediatrician called and said that she had a borderline abnormal result for the MCAD portion of her PKU test and that we need to come in for more testing. We're going in tomorrow. After doing some research, there's very little information about MCAD online (probably a good thing - the internet is usually full of scary stuff) and my doctor didn't give me too much information.
Have any of your little ones had this test come back abnormal? What was the results? Did they have MCAD or was it a false positive? If you do have a little one with MCAD, what is it like?
I'd appreciate any information! It seems like not the hugest deal in the world, but I'm still pretty scared. New mom paranoia and all.

"Hi r/Mommit!
This Mother's Day, I wanted to take some time and share some things about my mom that most people don't know about. My mother played women's professional ice hockey when I was young. My mother is a breast cancer survivor. My mother was a single mother of 3 until we were all grown. My mother is now a small business owner after years of financial struggle. I have been grown and gone for quite some time now, but shortly after I left the roost she started a new part of her life and had two kids. Unfortunately, for some unknown reasons, both of her children were born with [Chiari Malformation.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold%E2%80%93Chiari_malformation) After many years and countless dollars spent in medical bills including brain stem surgery, today was the first day I was able to spend hours with her where I didn't feel like she had the weight of the world on her. It's an indescribable feeling when you are happy simply because of someone else's happiness and peace.
So, I came here to share my happiness. And to share my gift for my mother this Mother's Day. My mother runs a very small business out of her home where she fulfills every role from owner to manufacturer. She was always one to sew and create my siblings and my clothing when we were young, and now she has designed and creates clothes for young children to babies. If even just one of you decides to stop by and take a look at what she pours every ounce of herself into I'm sure it would make her day.

"Hi there everyone, my 11 month old little girl has a thing about feeding her favorite toys! She shares her food and makes eating noises while holding the food to the toys mouth :-).  Which leads me to the amusing story, we had gone to stay with my parents for a weekend as they live far away and we try to get together once a month. Little girl is sat on the mat getting dry after a fun bath and my mother and sister were cooing over her. She starts to pretend to feed her duck which is her favorite animal, giving it some bath sponge, a bottle of shampoo and such when she leans forward, yanks down my top and attempts to get me to BF the duck while yelling her yummy noises!
My family didn't know where to look hehe!

In fact, when I was pregnant, I had all these diagnostics done on the little tater fetus, as she was measuring remarkable small my whole pregnancy.

She eats great, loves potatoes and cheese and milk but remained in the 15% for weight so we just considered that her average. 
Cue an ear infection that lingered for the month of September. I take her back to doc in beginning of October and her freakin' frackin' mothaf*cking growth chait as taken a dramatic dip. She didn't gain a bit of weight between September 6 to September 18 to October 2. She did grow linearly though which the doc says indicates she's not malnourished but does having stunted growth"" and her chart says ""Fail to Thrive."" ",2
"Hi there!

I'm hoping you can help me out.  I (26F) have a friend (late 20sF) and her husband (30ishM) who are expecting a baby in a few months (April-May ish).  They're so thrilled!  Except... for one pretty glaring issue, one side of their family is really not being as supportive as they should be.  The only thing this side of the family is doing is stressing our friends out!  They're trying to guilt our friends into changing their mind about decisions (like the location of baby shower, styles in baby's room, disclosing sex of baby or not, etc.)  Pretty much everything they can find an excuse to get upset about they are, despite the fact that ultimately this major life event belongs to only two people, our friends!

I'm trying to find ways to be supportive, while toeing that line of not butting my nose in too far.  Right now, I'm thinking ahead and trying to figure out gifts that are actually going to be the most useful for when the baby actually comes, and I'd like some input.  Some ideas I've had so far are:

A variety pack of diapers with one package in every size
A maid service for the first two-three months after baby has been born
His and Hers massages with offering of babysitting
Offering to make a meal a week for the first two-three months

I do not have kids, so I'm open to any other ideas or advice you have...I just really need any help you can give me.  I want to support her as much as I can. Please help!

"Hi there,  I'm writing to ask if anyone has any advice on what we can do to get our son to eat properly or at least something!  Since he started on solid foods as a baby he has always been fussy about what went in his mouth.  He would only eat baby food up until 12 months of age and no matter how much we tried to make him something a bit more nutritious or copying something he enjoyed commercially home made he would refuse.  We initially thought it was texture based as he was only ever keen on smooth foods.  As he got older he did start eating other (more grown up foods), but these are pretty limited to crumbed chicken, sandwiches such as chicken breast or cheese spread, he always ate yoghurts etc.  There really is only a handful of foods he will eat and none of them are very nutritious.  The only good thing we've been able to feed him is spaghetti where we have blitzed vegetables into it.  But that is hit and miss sometimes.  The issue is compounded by our 10 month old who eats everything in sight...although we are well aware that kids can be picky eaters (I certainly was).  After all this, he's a healthy weight, is growing larger than most of his peers and is normal in most other ways, except for some behavioural problems that have started to crop up lately...which is probably him being a two year old more than anything.
He's 2 years and 5 months and is still not talking, he has a handful of words but his progress is very slow and we worry that if hes not getting the right nutrition or eating the wrong things (i.e. junk) his learning ability might be affected...we do wonder if the two things are linked.
Any advice is appreciated
EDIT 1:  Thank you all for the sound advice and it's nice to hear others in similar boats and have had a good turn around.  We always feel guilty that we're not providing for our child enough (parents prerogative I guess).  But we want to at least look at other avenues to give him as many options as possible.

"Hi there. I'm 16 weeks pp and I just started my first period. I was exclusively breast feeding until about 10 weeks when my baby decided to fight my breast. I still breast feed at night when she's too sleepy to care, and I do during the day for 5-10 minutes before she gets mad. So is it normal for me to have one now? And how long did your first one last for. I didn't know where to post this question so I hope this is right. Thanks!",6
"Hi there...my first time posting in this group. †I want to share my problem and I know this is not going to be legal advice...but you just never know...you may have experienced something similar. †So here is my issue: My ex and I went to court about 5 years ago...I initiated it because he was not giving me any money to support our two daughters. He works full time for over 20 years for the city. During the case...I mentioned that I was moving out of state...over 3 hours away from them. †The judge decided since I was moving that the girls had to stay with the father...even though he did nothing..and had no place to live at the time. I went with it...even though I was torn...and moved anyway. In court he declined child support. †About two years later, he took me to court for child support. My issue with this is...since I have moved I have changed my life to become a stay at home mom. I left a career that was very stressful and had me away from the children for long periods of time. †I knew the only way I could be a decent mom is if I could get to a place where I didnt work...and stay home with my new baby. My girls stayed with their dad who ended up bouncing from place to place for a while until my uncle took him and the girls in for several years. They were essentially homeless and staying with friends. Ok..now they have a place...and apparently are doing ok. The neighborhood they live in is less then I would ever choose, but I guess he is doing the best he can. Meanwhile...I havent worked since I moved. †I homeschool my son who is 6 years old. †I owe a ton of money in child support and am not able to afford it. †I make a little money online from selling things but honestly it goes into home bills. †This summer I couldnt even afford to have the girls stay with me for the summer because I couldnt afford to get them. I feel like my ex believes that I am just a loser parent who doesnt do anything. †Well, I dont have the money that I used to have. And that doesnt amount for me being a good parent. But I am happier (except for this issue). My son has the priviledge of enjoying a free thinking homeschooling life and I know that if my ex really cared about the children having a life with their mother he would allow them to come and live with me. I have the space and the food to take care of them. †We dont have all the extras but I know I wouldnt spend the almost $400 a month on child support that is required of me to raise them here. What are your thoughts of what I should do, change, rethink....etc Feel free to ask me questions...I dont mind sharing....thanks.",6
"Hi there; My daughter is 2 1/2 mos and she refuses to sleep during the daytime. †I was told by the pediatrician to put her in the crib when she's sleepy but not entirely asleep after feeding her and let her 'cry it out'.

"Hi! I just found this sub as I'm standing in my kitchen making my kiddo's breakfast for the rest of the week. He just turned 1, and we started BLW at 6 months. He's a great eater now! I just wanted to share this in case others need a good breakfast.My son is in daycare 4 days a week and we send breakfast, lunch and an afternoon snack with him every day. Lunch has always been easy, but breakfast threw me for a loop at first since he wasn't eating food combinations yet. Over Christmas he tried (and loved!) a pancake, and it dawned on me that I could customize a pancake recipe to contain the nutrition I wanted him to have and be easily portable for daycare. **Luke's Favorite Pancakes:*** 1.5 cups flour (white or wheat both work well)* 3.5 teaspoons baking powder* 1 teaspoon salt* 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon* 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg* 1/2 a good sized sweet potato (about 300 grams)* 1 good sized apple * 2 eggs* 1/2 cup full fat plain greek yogurt* 3/4 cup milk of your choice* 1/4 cup butter1. Peel and cube the apple and sweet potato and cook until soft, about 8 mins covered in the microwave.2. While the sweet potato and apple are cooking, combine all dry ingredients in a large bowl.3. When the sweet potato and apple are cooked, put into the blender. Add the butter, cut into small pieces so it melts. Add the milk, yogurt and eggs. 4. Blend the wet ingredients in the blender until liquified. They should be more runny than not, so if they're a little thick add more milk. It should run more like chocolate syrup than applesauce, if that helps.5. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients little by little until all combined.6. Cook on a 300-degree griddle until bubbling, then flip until cooked through, about 5-6 mins on each side. Using this recipe, I can make about 50 pancakes with the circumference of a jam jar. They take some time to make, but they last us a little over a week in a gallon ziplock bag in the fridge and are easy to grab for a quick meal. My son usually has 4 pancakes and some fruit each day for breakfast, and my husband and I snack on the rest :)You can sub in any fruit (or veggie!) that your child likes, or that you'd like to sneak into his or her diet unnoticed. I think it would work as a savory pancake too if you used zucchini instead of the apple and adjust the seasoning.At any rate, I hope this helps anyone looking for breakfast options!",2

"Hi, Mommit. 
24121,
My nine month old son has not cut any teeth yet. Because of this, we're still limited to baby food / purees.

I have tried a hundred times to feed him little bits of cooked soft foods such as baked potato, banana, avocado, and hummus. He makes a chewing motion with his gums, but without fail, each time he goes to swallow anything with texture, he gags and then vomits up everything he had eaten in the last hour. This is despite making sure the food is always pea to rice sized to begin with. 
Is it perfectly fine to stick with purees, or should I keep trying with other textures? It really doesn't make a difference to me, I just don't want to hinder his development in the area of eating regular food. 
I didn't have this problem with my daughter, she got teeth at 3 months and would eat anything!",2

"Hi, my brother and his wife have a 3 year old girl who is usually moody and always whines when she doesn't get what she wants. The entire family has noticed and has tried to take different approaches but my parents (her grandparents) baby her when they watch her and so her habits continue.
So today everything was going well. We watched cartoons and I was playing with her. I put on Alvin and the Chipmunks on my tablet for her and we watch maybe half of it before she starts saying the word noodles"" in a very whiny way which means she's hungry. She always does this when she's hungry. I don't know if that's normal or not.So naturally we get her noodles and tell her to eat at the table which she does. My father takes my tablet and plays the movie for her while she eats the food. I have no qualms thus far. Two minutes later my mother tells her to eat her food  she wasn't saying she had her food in front of her but was just watching the movie. After a few more minutes of asking her nicely to eat her noodles as she watches my mom tells her that if she doesn't eat then I will turn the movie off. So I go up to my niece and ask her nicely to eat while she watches. No response. Eyes are glued to the tablet. I pause it and she gets all fidgety and I tell her to eat her noodles then I'll turn the movie back on. I managed to get her to eat one spoon full only because I said please and fed her myself. I told her if she eats a second spoonful I would unpause the movie. She reaches for the tablet herself and unpauses it. I take the tablet and ask her to please eat her food or there wouldn't be any movie for her. As soon as the tablet wasn't within her reach she gets up from her seat and walks away. I take that as her not listening so I put the tablet in my room in a high place so she wouldn't reach. 
She sees me do that and then starts bawling. She runs into the other room and closes the door and cries/screams. My dad gets angry at me for doing what I did and my mom can't console her. I tell them I'll go in and try to talk to her. I go inside and she's on the floor screaming and crying and I tell her in between her breaths when there's a split second of silence that when she calms down we can eat and watch the movie. After 10 minutes no dice. She keeps screaming and eventually it affects my parents who are going bonkers. My mom turns the movie back on in hopes of shushing her  nothing. Eventually my mom picks her up and shushes her with some tic tacs and cartoons. So... what are your thoughts on this? Please don't judge me. I'm 23 years old  in college and have no idea on parenting. I'm confused since I think my parents (and her parents) spoil her TL;DR: I think my niece is spoiled. Tried a new method on dealing with her tantrums. Didn't work and was met with anger by my parents. Suggestions? EDIT: should have added that if it were up to me I would have let her cry herself out if she wouldn't calm down. Is that cruel?""",2
"Hi, my name is Frankie, (age: 23) I gave birth to a beautiful, healthy boy named Lokii on 1.24.2014, and this is my first post in any community so, here goes..
It's been three weeks since my csection and I have been feeling overwhelmingly weepy, hopeless, and like a failure to my son because I'm having trouble functioning day-to-day with the new stresses of being a new mom. My boyfriend (Biagio, 31) works 14-16 hour days in a restaurant that he just opened in Oct. He is wonderfully supportive, helpful, and positive, but even with his reassurance, I'm still feeling really down.  Before being discharged from the hospital, my doctor put me on 150mg of Wellbutrin for my anxiety, which has helped with that, but anxiety and depression are two different things. Also, I was given a Depo birth control shot. I have an appointment on Monday to talk to my doctor about whats going on, but I was hoping anyone could help me with some advice for coping through the weekend. Googling advice has been fruitless for me (listening to music, watching funny shows or movies, etc..) and I just end up crying through them and eventually feeling worse as a result. Was there anything you guys found to be surprisingly helpful for the short term, just to get me through until Monday?",6
"Hi. I have a pretty easy going baby girl that sleeps 12 hours through the night, with a short nap during the day. In the last week or so, she has really been using her voice for expression. She is starting to scream to express when she's happy, excited and when we do something she doesn't want to do, like put her in the bath. After a few seconds she's fine but she definitely will scream if we take something away, make her eat when she doesn't want to or pick her up if she wants to be walking. Any tips for how to get her to stop screaming when she's upset? I love that she screams when she's excited but how do I redirect her expression when she is upset?",6
"Hi. I'm a mommy of a 12 month old baby who is more like a 5- 9 month old baby.   
Backstory: He was a few weeks early but I was REALLY sick during my pregnancy, he was almost pulled out of me early several times starting around 30 weeks. I had around 12 or so courses of antibiotics, a severe antibiotic-resistent infection which gave me kidney stones, surgery for the kidney stones, a bunch of xrays, almost daily ultrasounds, morphine drips, etc. One doctor at one point decided I was diabetic (despite faling a sugar test being a side effect of the antibiotic i was on) and put me on a super-restricted diet - after a few weeks finally realized it was a bad idea (blood sugar kept being in the 40s) but when I got moved to another hospital they ignored the second half and put me on the diet again for almost a week before realizing how bad it was. I was on blood pressure medicine and a ton of other stuff which included medicine to counteract the side effects of other medications. All trying to keep him in me longer which I'm not sure was even a good idea. Needless to say the baby came early at 37 weeks, he wanted out.     
Since I'd had a c-section for baby#2, it was decided that I had to have a c-section for him, too. My water broke at 4am, the labor and delivery team didn't arrive until 930 and by then I'd already been pushing for a half an hour. They never even checked where he was when they dragged me in to have the c-section (I kept saying let me push""). He was so firmly down the birth canal - close to crowning - that they had to push him back up. They had 5 minutes to get him before the general anesthesia got to his bloodstream Here we are a year later and he is very behind. I have him enrolled in early on and we have a team of physical therapists. He is evaluated to be approximately 3 months behind (some areas more  some less). He doesn't get himself to sitting yet He also doesn't eat very well yet. I have never had a baby that doesn't want to put things in their mouth. I can get him to eat stage 2 baby food and sometimes drink a little water or juice out of a cup (negligible amounts) and he is finally starting to eat cheerios those baby yogurt bites I tried getting him to try cake for his birthday and he wouldn't even touch it. I made a video  it's like it was a fire or something on his tray. It's like he can tell something is food I want him to eat and he won't put it in his mouth at all. The feeding therapist gave me stuff to try before she comes on tuesday and I can't even get him to touch it Communication wise he is also behind. He doesn't babble much. He is pretty quiet. He responds to his name and seems to understand a wide variety of words. He smiles when smiled at and is personable and cuddly. He doesn't imitate sounds or anything like that. Both of my other boys were late talkers so this might be nothing.  Our old doctor (we moved and are switching to a new one shortly) said to think of him as a three month early preemie because about 30 weeks is when my health really started to go downhill.   So  parents of kids who were behind - did they catch up? How long did it take?   Parents of children with disabilities (especially cerebral palsy) - when did you know something wasn't right? How could you tell? What tests did they do to confirm it? Now what?  Aside from working with him several hours a day and having him in therapy a few times a month  what else can I do? I'm trying not to worry but watching him be so far behind is heartbreaking.  
TLDR - regardless of the outcome please tell me it will be okThank you for your time!""",2
"Hi. Throwaway account. Not a mom. I'm 16 and I was asked to babysit my mom's friend's daughter. They told me not to give her any sweets because she'll get hives.

Hmmmm.....So you mean our lifetime of  experience doesn't count for anything?  If I were to make up a resume to apply for a grandmothers position my experiences would be off the page.  I've been through it all.  The sleepless nights rock hard balls that somehow found their way out of the diaper and down to the feet of their Dr. Dentons.   And lets not forget the numerous rashes I've encountered that almost qualifies me for an honorary degree in Dermatology. As grandparents we've  lived through the terrible two's beer drinking cutting school mouthing off... the list is endless.  And then there was college and the military where at least one of our children came home with yet another surprise - some horrific tattoo of a skull with a dagger through it.   ...and lets not forget the parade of unsavory boyfriends and girlfriends who showed up at the door.  All hours of the day and night.  One worse than the other.  How I ever survived those years is beyond me.  Yes I've experienced it all and my resume proves it.  You could say I've earned my badge of honor.    Somehow my children survived and successfully made it to adulthood... surprisingly with no broken bones or major catastrophes.   Now my precious little ones are all grown up and starting  families of their own.    My excitement and anticipation peaks at the thought of  becoming a first time grandmother.  My joy at hoping to be a significant part in my grandchild's new life is boundless as I entertain happy thoughts of bouncing that little one on my knee taking long walks and rocking them to sleep.  But somehow before I even get the chance to prove myself grandparent-worthy I'm told ""You don't know anything about babies.""  How could that be?  As a seasoned parent my lifetime of experiences had to result in some kind of wisdom.  How could I not know anything?I just don't understand this new internet driven generation and all the studies they refer to in order to back up their claims.  Whatever happened to human instinct?  The one that tells you when and how to tend to your baby's needs?   This new trend of ignoring a baby's cries and not feeding them until the clock strikes the right time in their schedule....    well this just seems inhumane to me.  I call this new way of doing things ""trends"" because parenting rules seem to change faster than fashion.  And just like fashion there is never a final point where you can say Maybe I don't know everything.  I never claimed to.  And yes I've made mistakes in my parenting.  But I've learned from them which gives me that much more experience.  One thing that always was and will never change I didn't take all of  my mother's advice but I didn't scoff at it either.  I listened to what she had to say and then I deciphered how much of that advice I would follow.   I believed she had to know something about babies because she raised 5 of her own  I took that advice and my children grew to be successful adults with no major catastrophes.  Oh sure my kids will disagree and continue to blame me for all of their deep psychological problems because of the neglect I bestowed upon them by not buying them the latest bicycle... or not allowing them to stay up past their bed time to watch the world series.  They will continue to say I'm the cause of the post traumatic stress disorder they now suffer from because all the other kids were allowed to stay out till midnight when they themselves had to be home by 10 p.m.   I guess all of this blame comes with the territory.  Still I would not trade my children for anything. Yes I am still learning the lessons of motherhood but I have built a strong foundation on which to stand as I step into my new role as grandmother.  I will smile and shrug it off when I'm told that I don't know anything when it comes to modern day parenting.  
I will take my lifetime of experience whether they are on schedule or not.",6

"How do you handle chores? My 7 year old daughter has two major chores in the house. She unloads the dishwasher and puts the dishes away. She unloads the clothes from the dryer and puts them in the appropriate spot (dump on our bed if ours, fold and put away if hers and/or towels.) She also moves the wet clothes from the washer to the dryer. She does not receive an allowance for these chores. These are things that she simply does as a part of the functioning household. In our family we believe that we all have responsibilities in the home that we simply don't get paid for beyond the satisfaction of having them done (and have a clean home, good food and all that other jazz). Mom and Dad go to work while she goes to school. When we come home we each have chores to do. As she gets older, her responsibilities will grow with her. She earns money by volunteering for other tasks/chores or agreeing to do them when asked for help. Three questions: 1) When did your small humans begin having regularly scheduled chores (at what age)? 2) What chores did you start them with...and how did they grow as the kids grew? 3) How did you handle the allowance thing? No allowance at all, paid a flat rate, paid per task, or paid for going above and beyond? Or did you have some other method?†",6

My son only sleeps 30 minutes at a time during the day, and 2 hours at night (waking up SCREAMING half the time). He cries all day unless we're outside (and sometimes that doesn't even work). I'm on a dairy free, gluten free diet and am loosing too much weight as I try and figure out why he is so uncomfortable all the time. My back hurts, my nipples hurt. He is breast fed and cloth diapered, so doesn't cost any money, but somehow we have drained all our savings and have to apply for food stamps. There's no time for our marriage. He screams in the car so we rarely go anywhere. It's hell. ",6
"I am a concerned uncle and my niece is 2 years old and can only say a few words like ma ma and da da and Minnie (as in Minnie mouse). Less than 10 words pretty much. She also randomly screams and repeatedly hits herself, my daughter and other objects for long periods of times when she isn't secluded in her room and crib.
She is also rail thin with long fingernails that my sister doesn't cut with the excuse of She doesn't let me."" So she pretty much scratches my daughter on a daily basis since we started living together. She can't eat properly herself and has trouble even holding a cup. She drops it constantly.
She also walks and runs crooked with her arms flailed out and her legs look bow legged when doing so. The part that really frustrates me is that my sister puts her down for naps at 11 am and we dont see my niece until 6 or 7pm and then at 9pm she is put down to bed. My daughter and my niece are a week apart to give you some perspective. My daughter can run and walk fine and normal. Can jump and catch a ball. She says a ton of words and understands what you are saying and can communicate back to you. She feeds herself with utensils and drinks out of regular cups and is super helpful. I used to just chalk it up to kids develop differently but there is at least to me something wrong with my niece or my sister's parenting or probably both. A little backstory is that my niece was born with Meconium aspiration and wasn't able to leave the hospital for a few months. I believe because of this she develops a little slower which is fine  but now at the age of 2 I am starting to feel my sister is the problem. I try and tiptoe around the issue and ask questions about my niece to my sister  So my question to all of you is are there side effects in terms of development because of meconium or is she autistic (because I have thought this as well with how much she screams and rocks back and forth and hits herself) or is my sister slowing my nieces development by locking her away and not really letting her...well do anything?
TL;DR My sister locks my niece away Im worried about her development",6
"I am a first time mom and my baby boy is 6 weeks old. I am breast feeding him, so I get up at night every 2-3 hours while my husband is sleeping. I know I should nap when my baby takes naps, but I just can't sleep during the day.. neither can I go to bed early when my baby falls asleep because I just can't fall asleep anymore. I am so tired that I can barely do anything. Some days are better than others, of course. 
How can my husband help me? He asks me - what can I do to help? But I can't come up with a clear answer. It's pointless to wake him up at night as I am the one who needs to feed the baby, but at the same time, it's rather frustrating to hear him snore while I am up most of the night. My biggest fear is that I will start taking it out on my baby. Please share your experiences..",6

I am a FTM and I have a 7 month old daughter. I am currently having issues with a friend that seems to bail out on days we plan to hangout and just won't adjust her schedule to a more convenient time to hangout. She basically parties all night and sleeps all day. I have made over a dozen plans with her to hangout and they always fall through and I'm getting frustrated. I wish I had mommy friends my age that would understand what it is like to have a baby. I literally plan my entire day around my daughter because I am a SAHM too. I can hangout between 8-2pm. Seems like a reasonable time to me right?? Wouldn't you say that is normal? Well she doesn't want to hangout until like 4pm and my daughter goes to sleep around 6pm and I need to make and have dinner before that time. I'm ready to blow up on said friend but I don't want to ruin our long friendship. She is like a sister to me. I just want her to see and understand that I have to go out of my way to plan a day to hangout with her and adjust my daughters schedule accordingly. My daughters naps and feedings revolve around all of it!! I can't be spontaneous anymore and get up and go like I used to! It's a process to get out of the house for a day. What would you do? Or what have you done? I would invite her over but I don't want to wait around all day for her at home just to have her cancel.. I need to tell her what i need to do in order to hangout.. Because I really don't think she even has a clue or understands. How could I put it nicely? I don't want to sound like a bitch.†,6

"I am a mother of three kids, ages 1.5, 3.5 and nearly 6. I am from rural Ireland and moved stateside about a year ago because of my husbands work. It was really exciting at first, and I have tried very hard to become enmeshed in the life here as we don't know how long we will be here, it could be for a long, long time.
But as the time passes it gets harder and harder. Parenting in a country that is so different in so many ways is such a challenge. 
For example, back home everyone I know is a stay-at-home-mother so you have so much support each day. Here, very, very few people are, so I am woefully lonely during the day. Yes, I have little Meetups and classes, but it's not the same. And I have heard several times from other mothers that Only the rich stay home with their kids
I hope I don't come across saying the way I am used to is better. There are a thousand things that are better here- more schooling options  more diversity I am just looking to hear from anyone else who has moved to a whole new culture when parenting and how you navigated all the changes?""",6
"I am a nanny of a set of 4 month old twins. My boss family just switched the kids to soy formula due to some sort of infection they've developed in their colon. The problem is, soy is lighter then regular formula yet it still has the same amount of calories. So the kids are getting very hungry a lot sooner then normal. We have increased their formula by half an ounce each feed but they still get very hungry quicker. Is there anything we can do about this besides giving them more? We don't want to risk over feeding them ",6
"I am a new mom with a 10-week-old boy. I have been reading 'Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Baby' and have been working on getting my son to sleep a bit more. Right now he only sleeps about 8-10 hours per day total. We started doing a bedtime routine and he can now self-soothe to sleep in his bassinet in our room at around 10pm. We just switched from swaddling to a grobag. He sleeps for about 5 hours before waking to feed and then after that is up again after 1.5-2 hours. He usually falls asleep in the swing during breakfast and when that happens, I turn the swing off and let him sleep. For the remainder of the day, when he seems to be getting tired, I try to put him in his crib (not his bassinet) for a nap. He is unable to self soothe to sleep. If I let him fall asleep in my arms and then place him in the crib, he wakes and cries after only a few minutes. I pick him up until he is calm and drowsy and then place him back in the crib. Before he even reaches the mattress, he starts to get upset. I try to extend the number of minutes each time before I go in to soothe but I cannot get him to sleep and then it's feeding time again (exclusively breastfed ~ every 2 hours during the day). Is it too early to start this process for naps? †Did anyone follow this book with good success at this age? At this age, will he learn this early that if he complains enough I will pick him up and develop bad habits? Thanks",6

I love my son more than anything and wouldn't trade him no matter how bad things get with his dad. Anyway! I've been single since I was about 6 months pregnant. His dad has come and gone in and out of my life and in and out of our"" son's. Seeing him when it worked with his schedule †and I feel stupid for saying this †we were still sleeping together even though we were so on and off depending on when he wanted to feed me lies (i.e when he didn't have another gf †when he needed money †when he wasn't moving dope around. YES THAT IS THE TRUTH †YES I TURNED THAT INFO AND A RECORDING OF HIM ADMITTING IT INTO THE POLICE NOTHING HAS HAPPENED WITH IT YET.) †of how he missed us †how he wanted to make our family work †how he needed us. BLAH BLAH.† anyway when he got married †I was done. I was done with him coming over to see our son †and what he was giving him (candy and gravy and peanut butter to a 6month old baby) so there was going to be no unsupervised visits after he ran off and got married to a girl noone knew existed except his family.† moving on. this arrangement of going to church lasted two weeks then his father stopped going so I didn't get any money and he wasn't seeing him. At this point I WAS DONE. I had tried to make things work on some level and every chance he got to bail he did. I sent my son two more weeks just to cover my butt then stopped sending him since our friend was becoming solely responsible for my childs well being when at church since his father wasn't there. I had not seen my son's father in almost 6 months †nor had I responded to calls and my son didn't need someone disrupting his schedule every couple of weeks when the mood hit his father to play daddy. NOW THE INTERESTING PART. Last night I get home †get my son to sleep. (he hadn't had a nap due to being with his grandparents since daycare was closed since their basement flooded) he was very cranky and tired. I put him to sleep a little early. I was getting ready to start dishes when I heard a knock on my kitchen door. I assumed it was my neighbor across the street since her daughter (2.5) loves my son (19 months) and we had just gotten home. I opened the door †we have a cse case set for the 17th of this month. I could either say what I wanted to him now †or I would have to wait to see him then. I have been having some anxiety about seeing him at this CSE since I haven't seen him since August. I didn't know what would go through my head or how I would feel. I decided I needed to see him now †since he was here and I was already having anxiety and just get that ""first time seeing him"" over with that way I had time to process anything I felt or whatever. So I unlocked the door and went outside †he was pulling out of the driveway but he stopped. I told him he had some nerve showing up uninvited †unannounced and that he was a pos and we have been doing fine without him and our son is so smart and so precious and so sweet and I'm not the one missing out he is †I basically lit into him. The whole time he is standing there telling me how he has changed he isn't doing drugs he isn't out running around hes moved out of his mom's basement he wants to be in his son's life he has grown up. BLAH BLAH BLAH. I'm not falling for it I have heard everything he said last night AT LEAST two other times from him. But I heard him out. I wanted to see if there was an angle he was trying to work and what not. After standing outside for half an hour he asked if he could see our son. I told him that he was sleeping he asked if he could at least walk in and see him he promised not to wake him up. Now I've screamed and yelled and belittled him for the past half hour he did drive over to try to talk to me I gave in a little and said fine u can walk in and see him. then we'll talk for a minute and u need to leave. FINE. He went in saw him he didn't wake him up came back out and sat down in the kitchen.†He told me he knows about the CSE I will be getting money through that when he gets his taxes in that he has already filed he will give me some of that. He asked me not to seek back child support at the CSE since it'll take him awhile to get caught up I wasn't going to make any decisions yet. one night of driving to my house uninvited didn't make me believe he was a good role model. HERE'S MY QUESTION:What do I do? He wants us to go to Orangeleaf tonight so he can see our son (who he hasn't seen since late Sept) if we decide not to go then he has already said he will stop by every night to see him while sleeping until I agree to more. I don't want to lose the healing I have done for myself (though I could look at him last night and it didn't hurt to see him I didn't have remaining feelings of hope at a relationship and had a good time together but I didn't want an us again.) and I don't want to ruin the progress or routine of my son. He listens to me we have our bond So what do I do moms. u can see this clearer than I can. Not sure if I can post this is r/singleparent since they may consider this ""ex-bashing"" sorry for spelling and that the post jumps around a little. I'm just trying to get it all out quickly. **EDIT: TL:DR My son's father has been in and out of his since birth he has never been supportive or helpful. We broke up due to lies and manipulation. He eloped with a girl who was pregnant by him then stopped seeing our son as we agreed. Haven't seen or spoken to him in months",6
"I am a single mother and most of the time it's just my son and I. Some times we will go have dinner with a friend and we go to church and our care group so he is exposed to other people. But when I take him to my grandmothers, whom he does not see often, he acts like a wild child. And when I say wild, I mean just that. here is no controlling him and it does not matter what I do. I try every trick in the book and nothing works. He will physically hurt me and run around yell all until all of my attention is on him. He will do this with anyone new who is with us. Even when I date and when it come's time for them to meet, which is not all that often as to any one I date will wait to meet him, he will act in the same manner. Now, I know he is trying to show off and get some sort of reaction out of me, but what I want to know is how do I prevent this from happening and if it does how to grab immediate control of the situation. Because, when it happens, there is no talking to him or even disciplining him. It almost as if he cannot focus or get control of himself. Thank you mommies :)",6

Is it possible to provide healthy meals for a family of five on that much without being stuck with casseroles and meatloaf? BTW the reason we have less of a grocery budget now than before is because we recently were blessed to finally get off of food stamps due to my husband working extremely hard and getting an amazing job. You would think that it would mean more money for food, but we were actually getting more when we were on it. Crazy how that works.

"I am about 30 weeks pregnant with my first child, and I stay at home to watch my sisters two children who are aged 5 and 3.
Originally my sister wanted me to quit my job to help her out, and she would pay my share of the rent and give me some spending money (300 a month...enough for me to buy my own things and pay some bills.)  Well, my boyfriend moved in and he pays half of the rent for our apartment.  For several months before I left my job he also watched them for free, which prevented him from finding work right away.  He buys food, though not as often as she does.  So essentially she's got a better deal on daycare now than she would have originally.
Neither one of her kids are potty trained, and she's making no effort to do so.  I've tried, but have kind of given up because I can't get her to bring home pullups and stuff...and the kids don't really feel a need to potty train because their mom doesn't expect them to.  Originally I felt bad for doing it, but now the 5 year old changes her own diaper.  I told her that I cannot do it anymore, the smell is just too awful for me now.  I tried to do the no pants thing with her, but she just smeared her feces all over the walls...or her brother's stuffed animals...or made piles of clothes to poop on.  I'm in over my head with that.
I am a full time college student, but I'm having a hard time keeping up with my classes because I am just so depressed.  I have no motivation to do anything, I feel like I'm trapped - and I know that I am starting to really resent the kids.  I feel bad about that.
My sister leaves for work before six am and often doesn't come home until after six pm.  I also have to watch the kids if she goes out to grocery shop, go to the gym, hang out with her friends, or go away for the weekend with her boyfriend.  I think she figures that since I'm home anyway being trapped in the house with someone elses kids all day isn't that big of a deal.  I try to reinforce with her that I'd appreciate it if she asked me ahead of time before she made plans.  She's not getting better about it, but my boyfriend and I went to visit his family for the weekend and she had to find a baby sitter.  
The kids were not very disciplined.  My boyfriend and I are kind of strict with them.  As in we expect them to eat at the table, pick up their own toys, and not be destructive with the house.  My sister has let them ruin the carpet and blinds in this apartment, pour food all over their room, and putting them to bed at night means they shut the door so they can turn the light back on and play until well after midnight while being as loud as possible.  She then lets them get up with her before 6am, so I imagine some of the behavior issues could be a bit better if they actually got enough sleep.
When she sees me get frustrated she tells me to just wait until I have my own kid because he'll be the same way, and I'm like huh?  No, I used to nanny for another set of children but they grew up with better standards and they were NOT like this at all.  They were very sweet.
My sister has been acting like my boyfriend and I are freeloaders in the house.  I've tried to explain to her that us being here is helping her out a lot.  300 dollars a month is nothing for childcare for these two kids, plus she only pays half the rent, and my boyfriend buys some of the food.  We've also spent a lot of money on taking the kids places and buying them clothes.  I don't feel appreciated at all and she was getting mad that I didn't have dinner on the table or the house spotless when she got home.  I finally told her that its just not easy for me right now, and she's mostly dropped it.  
She wanted to move to a new apartment, and she made weird comments about how we get all of the nice stuff"" because my boyfriend and I have the master bedroom in a three bedroom apartment.  We have to share a closet plus pretty much the rest of the apartment because we can't have anything outside of our bedroom without it getting destroyed (and not replaced.)  We pay half the rent  so it's kind of insulting. She called me while driving home the other day to complain about her job and told me that I should be glad that I don't work so I don't have to deal with that stuff.  I got very upset and told her that  ""Yes but her comment really upset me.  I have no time for myself and my first baby feels like my third child.  She sees her kids for a couple hours a day before she puts them to bed.  She has no idea what I go through. I wrote on the parenting forum before and people said I had to move out immediately.  It's not possible  but my boyfriend has a really good job now (he was paying for everything with his veterans disability) so we decided that within the next year we will be getting our own apartment.  It will be nice because our son can have his own room and I was like no way am I getting up and dragging my infant over there  at 5am for god knows how many hours a day.)  I'm learning to be more firm with her about what I'm willing to do. Anyway so there's a light at the end of the tunnel for me but I really need help dealing with her kids. I start to feel like I resent them",6

"I am having a hard time getting stuff done around the house with my 9 month old son...
On an average day I need to do laundry, wash dishes, make the bed, take care of the dogs, vacuum, swiffer & sweep the wood floors so baby doesnt find anything to put in his mouth, clean up messes we make throughout the day, make dinner etc...and that's not counting the breastfeeding, making him meals, keeping him happy and changing diapers. 
He is crawling and pulling himself up onto things now and can walk when holding onto furniture. He is also very clingy and needy. I have been reading The Wonder Weeks and it seems like this is very normal but I can't seem to get anything done. He wants to be held all day. If I put him down and walk a few feet away he crawls over and stands up pulling on my leg which leaves me unable to move. If I move him he'll just do it again. He usually throws a tantrum if I dont pick him up or I finish what I'm doing. A few times this has led to him falling and banging his head.
 If I put him in anything that restricts him moving around the house (playpen, swing, exersaucer) he freaks out. I know it's probably ok to let him cry for a few minutes but it makes me so anxious and gives me a headache. Not to mention it makes me really sad. 
:( I worry he is stressing out his brain or something.

I've tried using an Ergobay carrier but he doesn't care for that unless we are outside. 
I am not getting anything done unless he's sleeping and sometimes if he falls asleep on the boob I just have to leave him bc he wakes up if I move him and I'd much rather have a few quiet moments to play on my phone or watch tv instead of him waking up and being cranky. His nap(s) is usually only 30 minutes anyway. 
He has a bunch of toys but doesn't seem very interested in them unless I'm playing with him. He loves the Baby Einstein movies but it really only keeps his attention for 5 minutes or so. 

How do you ladies get stuff done in your house? Is it while they are napping mostly? I feel like I never get a break! I forget to feed myself most days and can't get a shower in until my husband comes home. 

Sorry for the rant/rambling. Thanks in advance for advice!

People are regularly shocked that he is the age he is. On the other hand, while he is the smallest in his grade one class, the next larger kid is barely a half inch taller. For the purposes of this, please picture a skinny, knobby-kneed little dynamo weighing a whopping 35lbs.
He is intellectually, emotionally, developmentally otherwise perfectly normal. His vocabulary is huge. Hair, teeth, nails in good shape. If anything, he's a little bloody hyper. He does not lack for energy, lol. His appetite is phenomenal and we eat rather well, if I do say so myself.
He's just really small.
And my doctor is worried. 
But frankly, I don't get it. I've spoken to her about this before. My son has two half brothers, both were also extremely small. His father claims to be 5'7 and is dreaming in technicolour on that one. His grandmother is barely 5' and his great-grandmother technically qualifies as ""midget"" (which I believe is being under 4'10""? I know if I'm wrong I'll be corrected!). I don't hug her because no matter how far I bend overMy middle step-son was put through absolute hell because of this. Special diets tests. They gave the poor bugger barium enemas for fuck's sake. He let me taste one of his ""special pudding""s once. It tasted like someone had put a rusted nail in a pig anus and let it melt into a pudding. It was all he was allowed to eat besides potatoesSo what's the big deal? Why is there this need the rush to diagnose
In the end we all have our crosses to bearHe's just small. Yeesh.""",6
"I am just curious with rising obesity numbers and the increase in preservatives and stuff in food, but with many moms being busy juggling work or home and children, how you feel about junk foods? 
Is a place like MacDonalds considered a treat, an 'absolutely-not' or a regular occurrence?",2
"I am not a parent but I have an 11 year old brother who is an extremely picky eater. The kid doesn't even like Macaroni and Cheese or Spaghetti and Meatballs. He basically only eats chicken nuggets, chicken wings, hot dogs, french fries, etc. Won't eat a cheeseburger because he doesn't like the cheese....Anyway, we have seriously tried and tried to get him to eat more but he won't budge. We've been to the point where won't let him leave the table until he takes a bite of vegetables and he'll literally just throw it up right back onto his plate. I feel like my parents have just given up because they don't have the energy anymore (I am 21 and have a 22 year old sister). Needless to say, my little brother is not growing like he should be. He is by the far the shortest among his friends and I am convinced it is because he isn't getting enough nutrition. (My sister and I were always pretty much average height growing up.) My brother does not have an issue with being too skinny - he eats enough junk to take care of that. It's just that he's not growing vertically and I would love to hear some advice. I stumbled upon a website that advertised multi-vitamins for picky eaters a while back but I never went through with it. Now when I try to look it up, I just run into an ocean of different advertised pages pitching their own products. I would love to hear what everyone thinks, if they know of any good vitamins, or if they know of any other solutions to this. Thanks!",1
I am on a very budget other wise i would take them out for dinner or something  What are some good ways on showing my appreciation? (for my sister and mom),6
"I am really afraid I have PPD.
I don't know for sure...because I don't fit all of the symptoms. I don't know if I am just overly tired....?
I love my daughter, and I love being around her. Yes, sometimes I need a five minute break, but other than that, I'm fine. 
I cry all the time. For no reason! And my husband and I fight. I am being so mean to him and I have no idea why and no way to control it and oh Batman it hurts to watch me hurt him. 
I worry so much about Alice. I am afraid I over worry. I can't leave her in her swing to go to the bathroom or wash her bottles. She sleeps in  my bed with me and my husband on the floor. 
I can be super happy, or super sad. I know for a fact that this has to do with how I weighed 255 lbs. the last time I weighed myself. Before I had Alice, I was down to 190, and so proud of myself. Now I feel like I will always be the fat ugly mom. I feel like I can't lose any weight! 
I barely eat because I have no appetite. I do eat enough food during the day, but I have to force myself. 
I just need advice as to where to go from here. I had Medicaid until Alice was born, but now I have to apply again for myself. And it just takes so long....I don't want my life to be like this for that long. I love my fantastic, amazing hubby. He does literally everything he can to make me smile. And he is always exhausted because he takes care of his grandparents, whom we live with. His grandfather has such bad dementia my husband had to clean poop off of the bathroom floor because his grandfather forgot where the toilet was. And his grandmother is slowly fading too...asking question over and over...getting angry for no reason. He never sleeps and here I am being a super bitch. 
Is this just my fault? Do I just need to toughen up like my Mother in law says? Any advice would be so appreciated. My heart hurts and I am so sick of crying when my husband is trying to put a smile on my face. I want to be a great mom and not worry too much. 
Thank you, ladies. 
Edit: Grandpa is going to a home in about two months, but that is a long time when you have to check every 30 minutes that he hasn't turned on the gas and the burners on the stove again. Also, I'm sorry if this post rambles or makes no sense in places. I am crying and venting as well. ",6
"I am seriously at the last end of things here. I have no idea where to go from here and I'm running out of options. 
I was just told today that our food stamps will be cut in half. Not because of something I did, but because someone messed up before and gave us more money than we should have had. Now I am faced with finding that extra money in our already non-existent budget to try and feed my family. I am a stay-at-home-mom, simply because any job I could get, wouldn't make as much as child care would cost. I have looked into the state helping with child care, but from what I hear, it's very unlikely that we would qualify, and if we did, we would have a hard time finding someone reputable who wouldn't charge above and beyond what the state pays.
I am just so frustrated and upset. My daughter's birthday is next month (the 7th) and I am now faced with trying to figure out how to buy presents for her when our electric is late and I know that we're losing those food stamps next month. As it is, we have little-to-no extras in our family. Our only extras include eating out (at Mc Donalds or something) and going to my Moms house. Those are obviously out of the picture now, but I know that won't save us enough to make up that lost money. I seriously have tried to come up with every idea I can and I can't think of anything else. I am starting to understand why people turn to illegal ways to make money. Does anyone out there know what I can do?
~Update~ 
I want to thank you all for your ideas and comments. I've done my best to keep up with this thread, but I know I've missed somethings. I wanted to thank the couple people who have sent PMs and offered to help. I also wanted to let everyone know that we have enough to at least get the daughter's birthday presents that she REALLY REALLY wants. I am going to keep looking for ways to make money (including looking into day care at my home) and to do what I can.

Here are some pictures of her birthday!! Thanks to all those who help.

"I am so emotional wrapped up in this issue that I can't think straight or make any decisions, and I would so appreciate hearing what other moms think!
26220,
26221,We moved into this row house just before having DD2, who is now 3 weeks old. DD1 is 2 years old. Disclaimer: I am extremely clean, to the point where everyone I know thinks I am a clean freak with OCD. Which is why it makes no sense that this has happened!!! I have seen 3 black cockroaches in the last week!!! 1 in our master bedroom, 1 in the kitchen sink, and 1 scampering out of the kitchen cupboard and behind the stove!!! 
26222,
26223,I can't decide whether to stay and try to deal with the issue, or to find a new place and move out.
26224,
26225,The landlords won't do anything until I prove with photo evidence, which I haven't been able to get yet. We are thinking of hiring an exterminator ourselves, getting a cat to help with pest control, and maybe contacting the health department?
26226,
26227,I'm a SAHM of a toddler and newborn, and OH works long hours, and I don't know how much longer I can keep up with everything. I'm tandem nursing and I'm exhausted. Ever since this happened I have been spending all my free time cleaning and disinfecting everything all the time. I've been laundering all sheets every day, disinfecting the entire kitchen and bathroom every day, washing all the dishes before and after use, I just can't keep up with it.
26228,
26229,I have so many nightmares about roaches crawling on my children, crawling all over our food in the cupboard, my children dying of diseases from the roaches, roaches crawling around inside our walls and breeding. I'm terrified.
26230,
26231,There are so many issues with the house besides just this. The fridge is breaking down, there was a leak in the bathroom that we complained about when we first moved in and the landlords brought a plumber to fix it when DD2 was 2 days old, and he started welding and making fumes and we had to suddenly leave the house. And then he had to cut open the wall to do some work and after he left the landlords put it back up with duct tape! Yes duct tape!!! There have been endless minor issues the entire time we've lived here and the landlord is up almost every weekend fixing something! There are all kinds of issues with the house, like random holes and cracks in the wall etc. 
26232,
26233,But how in the world with a toddler and newborn can I find time to find a place, pack, and move? And then unpack again? Can you hire people to do all that for you and how much does it cost?
26234,
26235,We are in loads of debt and meant to live in this place for a few years and pay off all our debt, and we can't afford to move, but what difference can another thousand or two make really?
26236,
26237,We have a lease and we may have to forfeit our deposit to break it, and we gave pre-authorized cheques for a year so we'd have to pay our bank a fee to cancel the remaining 9 cheques too. 
26238,
26239,I just don't know what to do!!! What would other moms do in my situation??? I just want to be happy and spend this time being happy and enjoying my family, I really resent having to worry about this.

"I am so fed up. Every lunch, every dinner - it's a battle I'm tired of losing.
My son is just about 3.5 years old. He's NEVER liked table food. I started trying things when he was 7 months old and he refused everything. Relatives and doctors alike would just say when he's older He eats oatmeal  pancakes  granola bars  fruit snacks  teddy grams I'm tired of it. I'm so exhausted of making him his own dinner while my SO and I eat something else. I've had enough of saying ""Aiden  PLEASE eat."" And I'm sick of feeling like a **failure** as a mother. I don't know what to do to get him to eat. I don't want to get frustrated anymore; I want to make a single meal for my family and sit down and eat the same thing all together. Is that a dream I will ever reach? I'm out of ideas. I'm ready to just give him what we eat Thanks for listening to my rant!""",2
"I am stuck in a rut. I am a horrible cook but I want to make fast, nutritious meals for my family.

"I am sure we all have inner mantras, even if we don't realize it.
Sitting here at the dinner table, I realized I have several.
*She must have a reason. She must have a reason.* - I don't know why the fettuccine noodles belong in my empty water glass. But she does. Otherwise, why would she put them all in there? She's eating some, both on their way into and out of the tumbler's confines. So, *she must have a reason.* I have to remember that it's not hurting anything.
*Kids are natural experimenters. Kids are natural experimenters.* - They want to know everything.  Why does the cat think it's fun to play with a noodle when I wave it around? How can I make the cat play more?"" I don't want the cat playing with the noodles  so it's not a loss. *It'll wash out. Kids are washable. Clothes are washable. It'll wash out. Kids are washable. Clothes are washable.* - She is wearing the sauce. For some unknown reason it feels good to her to run her messy fingers through her hair during dinner. Maybe it's the novelty of actually *having* hair to mess with. Maybe it's a good way of getting your fingers clean There are some mantras that happen during the day  too. *It won't hurt her that bad to take a tumble off the couch. She needs to learn what happens. It won't hurt her too bad. She needs to learn.* - And learn she does. When she gets the booboos that actually sting a little  she will tell me. I will kiss it *At the end of the day  she loves me my daughter is a ""spirited child."" That's a kind way of saying ""active  strong-willed  opinionated stubborn pain in my behind."" And we tousle. And I am sure the shrieking stream of babble coming out of her mouth is toddler-ese for ""I hate you! You're so mean! You never let me do anything I want! It's not fair!""

"I am the father of two small children.  I certainly don't wish to tell anybody how to parent their children, but I would like to take a moment to rant about two topics which I have noticed recently related to parenting, and I am curious if others have noticed this and are bothered by it.
**Topic 1: Public Discipline** 
On reddit, usually on subreddits that are not parenting related it seems like I have noticed a disturbing trend over the past year where people seem to cheer parents who harshly discipline children in public.  I understand that some people feel like modern children are out of control, but it disturbs me how often they feel that violence is answer.  Those of us who try to explain that calm, nonviolent but firm discipline is better for children end up getting accused of being permissive and pushovers who are raising spoiled kids.  It's infuriating.  
**Topic 2: Snacking**
I have noticed that the parenting my wife and I do is very different from everybody else around me with regards to the topic of snacking.  Most of the fellow parents around me seem to find it acceptable to let kids snack all the time, and usually on carbohydrate filled snacks like Cheerios and crackers.  I know parents that always have some form of snack on hand for the child and when I've talked to them they claim that they find cheerios and snacks all over the house.
First off, why is the child eating food while wandering around the house?  Maybe it's just my family, but we try to limit eating to sitting at the kitchen table.
Second, do you realize the damage that you are doing to your child?  Cheerios is not health food, and even if it was a health food, encouraging your child to constantly eat all day does not help to teach good dietary practices.  Cheerios and crackers are basically just carbohydrates.  If you've been following the fitness news for the last 10 years or so you know that research is solidifying around the understanding that carbohydrates (which breaks down into sugar) is the primary culprit in making us fat.  Getting a child hooked on a constant source of carb snacks and a constant supply of sippy cup apple juice is essentially just pushing your child into early obesity.  It breaks my heart to see it.  I know overweight parents who do this and just think, well [/rant]""",2
I am the mother of a son who was born premature in Jan 2011. He stayed in the hospital for three months. Upon his release was put on special formula. We have had him weened since July. At home he drink regular whole milk. Every time he comes home from his dads he acts and poops different. After a huge battle last night I found out the only difference in his diet is that his dad is giving him organic milk(his dad was aware of the strict diet he should be on). I did some research and found that organic milk can be good for you. I plan on talking to the doctor and nutritional specialist today. I was just wondering if anybody here has an opinion or experience with organic milk. Could this be the root of his digestion problems?,6
"I am the mother of a wonderful 6 month old baby boy.  My husband and I are using the Sears/attachment parenting philosophy as our model.  We co-sleep and breastfeed on demand.  Since our son was born I have been the one to put him to sleep.  Initially, I tried really hard to ensure that he did not develop a breast only sleep association, but my husband is in the military and has been gone for the past four months (home occasionally on the weekends) and it was just so much quicker and easier to put him to sleep on the boob that I got a bit lazy.  Our son now clearly has developed a breast/sleep association. This, I acknowledge, is my fault.  
My problem:  our son naps pretty well but wakes up every couple of hours at night and needs a bit of help settling.  When I am in bed with him it only takes a couple of minutes, but in the early evening, before I have gone to bed, it can take between 20mins and 40 minutes, as he has baby radar and wakes up when I try to sneak out of the bed.  When my husband is home on the weekends and we are enjoying a movie or a meal and my son cries the default is for me to go settle him.  Since this happens about three times an evening, every evening, it is starting to grind on me a bit and I want to share the responsibility with my husband.  He feels like it will take him three times as long to get him to settle down so is resisting my requests for help. I can accept this while he is still away and only home on the weekends but when my husband returns to our house next month full time I think we need to make a change.  Any advice on how to ease into a transition of more shared parenting that is not too hard on our baby or my husband?  ",6

This is my environment, formula feeders are the outcasts, who are left to make it on their own more or less.

"I bought a life size skeleton a month ago.  I've been scheming on interesting ways to use it to amuse the kids and myself.  
Last night, after the kids went to bed, I set Steve the skeleton up standing with arms stretched out in the hall way facing their bedrooms.  When the kids woke up,  I introduced them to Steve.  When they were eating breakfast,  I put his arms down and turned his head towards the direction they would be coming from to go brush their teeth.  
After they left for school I put Steve in one of their beds.  Everyone knows that skeletons sleep during the day.  I think after they go to bed tonight,  I'll either put Steve at the dinner table or on the toilet.

"I can't believe this is what I'm making a throwaway account for. I had always hoped it would be to post hot nude pics or something, but my life is not that fucking interesting.
I don't have the time or energy for shit like that, or for fucking anything interesting, because I have a goddamn baby.
I am so goddamn tired of waking up every three hours, or every two hours, or every hour, to the sound of a fucking banshee in my ear. I hate that I cannot press mute and ignore that shit, and leave that motherfucking baby to scream herself to sleep. I hate that my body is dragged from a sleep that doesn't even feel like sleep because it's so goddamn brief, to feed a baby that will scream at me some more if she's not positioned exactly the right way or put down before she's ready.
I'm so fucking tired of the screaming.I loved my husband so much. I was so incredibly in love with him that I thought the only possible expression of that love would be to bear him child after child with barely a pause between. Now I want to smother him with a pillow because the sound of his loud breathing is driving me over the edge as I lay in bed, seething and unable to go back to sleep. And I really don't want to ever have another child, despite the fact that my hormones conspire once a month in an effort to convince me otherwise.
Because I feel like having just this one kid was a big fucking mistake. I realize I'm a selfish evil cunt for even thinking this shit, but I feel like I traded my life as I knew it for this thing that screams at me every couple of hours, night and day, and gives nothing back. Yes, the baby is cute. She's very cute, and its amazing to watch her grow, but I have nieces and nephews, and I can watch videos of cats being cute, and I could be sleeping eight hours a night. Or even six hours. Five would also be acceptable.
I have no hobbies anymore. I have no social life. I'm amazed that my friends even bother asking me to do things with them, because more often than not, I have to turn them down because the minute the baby hits the car seat, she is, of course, screaming. There is no regular nap time, there is no time that I can depend on to call my own to get anything done. I don't want to bother starting anything, because I will have to abandon it when the screaming starts.
For the first four months she had colic, and that was... worse. That was worse than this. But now we're approaching a year of interrupted sleep, and I feel like I am going to lose my mind. It's a good thing suicide is more complicated than finding the ctrl-alt-delete buttons hidden somewhere on my body, or this shit would have been shut down at 4am or 5am or 6am long ago.
All I can do is clench my jaw and do what she wants, because she's a motherfucking baby and has simple goddamn needs and I have to meet them when I can figure out what they are. She's perfectly healthy, by the way! The picture of health! Hit every milestone early! Isn't that fantastic! What a set of lungs on her! Have you ever heard such a lusty cry?!?! She is the loudest goddamn child I have ever heard. Ever, in any setting, at any age.
All I can do is silently seethe with rage and post anonymously to reddit because I can't say any of this shit out loud. Because as much as I hate this, as much as I desperately want my old life back, which, while pretty boring, consisted of something other than crying in my weekly shower, popping ibuprofen for my jacked-up back and shoulder muscles, and taking sonic damage in between loads of laundry and endless rounds of uninspired chicken dinners, as much as I hate this, I have bought the ticket and now I must ride the ride.
I really hate this. I fucking hate this, and there is no way out. I'm not a coward or a psychopath, and no one else needs to know how crazy I feel, because there's nothing to be done about it. There is not a thing to be done.
I clench my jaw. I cry. I try to go back to sleep.*EDIT:* So, I'm not actually evil! You are all amazing, thank you so much. My husband is a total Vulcan about this topic, and I've been feeling like an isolated wreck for a while now. I called up a far away doctor-friend today and he confirmed and echoed many of the thoughts posted here. I'm going to try to get various kinds of local help (medical, social, beer-related) and prepare for some new night time strategies. Maybe I will be able to post a happy post soon, with fewer cuss words, written at a more reasonable time of day.",6
"I can't take credit for this recipe, but alas, I write it down, and now can't find the website where it came from... Anyways, this took me like 10 minutes to prepare, and LO can't get enough of them. She's been inconsolable since she started teething, so the hour it takes for her to demolish one of these are happy and best of all quiet! So here you go..Banana-pear teething biscuitsIn a food processor blend one ripe banana and one ripe pear with 1/4 cup water, blend till smooth. Add 1/2 cup rice cereal. Blend again until smooth. Add about a cup of whole wheat flour (I think the recipe called for brown rice flour but I didn't have any), or a little more, until you have a sticky dough. (For this next part, I lined my cookie sheet with foil- it made picking up the cookies a lot easier) drop a hearty scoop of the dough onto a cookie sheet- there's no exact way, just form them into the shape you want, flatten them to about 1/4 inch thick. The easiest way to work with the dough is to get your hands wet and flatten it, I made them oval, about 2"" by 4"". This is optional, but I also took my spatula, and dipped it in water and made little lines in the cookie for texture. Bake at 350¬∞ for about 30 minutes- but keep an eye on them... my first batch took only 15 minutes because they were so thin. They're sort of a leathery texture. I put some back in the oven to toast and they were crunchy. LO loved them both ways. ",4
"I can't tell what's happening. My son who is almost 10 months now is learning to stand and walk. In the past when he was learning to roll over, and learning to crawl - he would wake up every 3-4 hours and sometimes every 45 minutes.
This time it seems...different.
We put him down to bed around 6:30, which is when he's usually ready to go down. Anywhere between 6:30-7:30 depending on how he's acting.
He woke up tonight around 10:30 and started crying like he usually does. Normally we give him 3 minutes to see if it's just some kind of shuffling and fussing in which he does go back to sleep, but this time he was more livid. Mom went in and offered him some boob, but he kept pushing it away and was crying. He didn't look like he was in pain, so she checked his diaper...clean. Nothing appeared to be wrong other than he was unsettled. So she cuddled for a bit and put him back down to sleep. He was fine for about 30 seconds after she shut the door and then he started sounding even more frantic.
I gave him an extra 5 minutes and he was just really going at it. I prepared a bottle of formula thinking maybe that's what he wanted. I went in and he wanted to be picked up, but didn't want to be held. I cradled him and he fought it. I offered him his lovy blanket which he'll usually cuddle, but threw it into the crib and was screaming at this point. I did a puff test to see if he was in pain. (I'll blow into his face to get him to stop crying for a second. This will usually slow down his breathing and help him calm down) but he screamed through it.
Finally I got a good look at his eyes and it creeped me right out. They were kind of open and kind of not. They seemed black and souless. The lights weren't on in the room, so it's not like he was being blinded.
We finally turned on the lights and he squinted, shuffled, and opened them. He was still fussy but not like he was 3 minutes before. He took 4 oz from the bottle, was happy, and then we prayed for him and i cradled him again. This time he was more apt to let me do it. I put him down in the crib and he fussed for 2 seconds before flopping down and going to sleep.
This has kind of happened before during his developmental milestones. Right now he's learning the concept of walking and standing from sitting position. I'm wondering if learning this a bit early has anything to do with it? I've heard of the 18 week sleep regression and one more around this time. Could this be it?
What has your experiences been? We're worried because the thought of my child having these experiences in his dreams where he is supposed to be safe and where I can't protect him is very much gut-wrenching for mom and myself.
We read online that a good idea might be to wake him up purposefully around 3 hours after we put him down for a snack and cuddle before going back to sleep. We'll give this a shot, but I'm looking to see what Reddit Parents have to say.
Thank you guys so much! I post a lot and feel that I have an awesome supportive community here to help me know I'm not that crazy or the only one going through stuff like this!
He's down and mom and I need to go to bed, but I'll check this and respond in the morning.",6
"I come to ya'll not as a parent, but as a son.  A 23 year old son who is witnessing his hometown be torn apart because a 12 year old girl was murdered by two boys (brothers) over bicycle parts.  All I ask is that you take time to talk to your kids, eat dinner with them, like mine did.  Ask me about my day, regardless how much of an asshole I was that day.  Speak with them, get to know them, not as a son or daughter but as a friend.  Share hobbies and quality time.""

"I crossed baby clothes off the list since that seems to be the main thing that parents tend to get TOO much of (I think so at least?). I don't have any children, so I need some guidance. I thought about diapers, but they told me that they were gonna subscribe to something so that they get diapers delivered all year round (maybe I should still send a couple?). I thought about maybe some baby food making tools, but they're already buying a baby bullet. My brother's girlfriend's family is going to spoil this child for sure and I'm sure they'll get everything that they'll need, so I'm lost... I am all about education though, so I'm definitely sending some baby books. Reading to your children is important! Otherwise... IDK. Maybe I'll just do the easy thing and buy clothes. *[Edit] So, I've already added some things onto my wishlist on Amazon: diaper depot (holds diapers, wipes, etc.), teething necklace, some teething tablets to help for pain, and that stroller thing that was suggested to me. I'm still open to suggestions.",6
I currently make almost all of my 7 month olds food. The only exception is the cereal. Everything else I prepare for her myself. This has worked out amazing for us. BUT...My sister in law is getting married next  weekend and it's a plane ride trip away. We will be there for 5 days. I am not going to have the capability to make my little one's food for her. I am considering jarred food for the trip to make it a little easier on everyone involved. Has anyone transitioned from homemade baby food to jarred baby food? Any recommendations on brands preferred? Anything? Thanks in advance!,2
"I desperately need your help, r/Mommit . . . I'm sobbing as I write this. I apologize in advance for the length (I want to give you all the details) and lack of fluency (I'm so sleep deprived I can no longer think straight.) My baby girl is just shy of 6 months old. She has never been a †good"" sleeper. At 6-8 weeks she had a few 4 hour stretches (in a swing) On a nightly basis †she wakes up crying anywhere from 8 to 24 (yes 24) times †she wakes up and is UP (not crying just awake) for 1-1/2 to 3 hours! She will only sleep in her travel system. I have had no luck getting her to sleep longer than a few minutes in her crib. I tried cosleeping for the first few months †but it was no better. I read No Cry Sleep Solution and implemented many of the strategies but she just wakes up too many times to put a sleep plan in place. I would literally have to be up all night long. I really really don't want to let her CIO. I've tried the attended CIO for a few hours and I just couldn't take it. She has a bedtime routine and a ""lovey."" She goes down around the same time every night (7-7:30) and wakes herself up around the same time every morning (6-7 †so she's beginning to nap longer but with no improvement in the night wakings. I have read and read and read and have never found a description of a baby waking this frequently †which makes me feel even more alone and upset.†We tried having dad respond to her crying †but he didn't handle it well and he has to work early. We have NO ONE else to help; neither of us has family involved in our lives or friends in a position to help. She is EBF and only just now is beginning to accept a bottle †but will only eat an ounce or so over a couple hours and then demands to be nursed. I'm beginning to really hate nursing and am considering switching to breastmilk in a bottle to see if that will help. I'm considering starting rice cereal before bed (as various people have been pushing for months but her doctor said not to do).†She has no symptoms of reflux. She doesn't seem to have a belly ache. I don't consume gluten or dairy. She is happy during the day (except for the tiredness †of course.)†I feel like I'm going to go insane. I'm so tired. I miss my husband. I miss my bed. I want to enjoy my baby (and my other children). There seems to be no end in sight. I don't know what to do †but I can't keep doing this. I sometimes feel resentful and angry towards my beautiful baby (though I know it is obviously not her fault.) Between night sleeping and naps How do I get her to sleep outside the stroller? How do I get her to sleep longer? How can I get my life back without making her suffer? **TL;DR -- My 6-month-old wakes up 8-24 times a night including a long stretch †will only sleep in her travel system. *Edit: Bold TL;DR **Edit: Thank you sooo much for all the ideas and responses; you are all so thoughtful!

"I did a quick survey of ~160 picture books, chosen at random, from my bookshelves, and discovered that on average, the books show ~35% female characters. There were 6 books with only female characters, and 38 with only male characters. I was surprised by how even families that avoid TV can have a heavy dominance of male characters in media -- something I try to avoid. What can we, as parents, do to counteract this? My current plan is to replace pronouns where possible -- most animals are referred to as he"" when it could just as easily be ""she"". This should work until my son is reading on his own.
As an example  here are the six books with only female characters:
1) Katy and the big snow (Virginia Lee Burton)

The vast disparity",6
"I didn't. 
What you saw was a heavily pregnant lady holding a leash to seemingly the world's best behaved Labrador mix, followed by a lovely well behaved toddler who charmingly and literally blew kisses at everyone. We seemed calm, collected and happy. My ponytail hid the fact that I had baby food in my hair and the dog must have licked the last of it off my child's face because that too looked miraculously clean.
The reality was. We came to the dog park to escape the chaos at home. I can't sleep lately because I'm a whale about to pop. Add a dash of hormones. The toddler child threw at least five screaming fits that morning which somehow involved a food explosion (hence the ponytail). The dog got overly excited so I let her out... But the neighborhood cat was visiting so she went nuts barking and chasing it getting her paws all muddy before rushing into the house and jumping all over my couch. Did I mention my son was having a toddler day? Screaming, yelling, thrashing, tears, snot, spit, poop... everywhere all because his cheerios were on the floor... where he threw them. Also, I should mention that all this occurred before 8:00AM (my neighbors love me). So. I found my happy place. Grabbed a granola bar. Cleaned the dog. Picked up my son still kicking and screaming and loaded the entire uncivilized bunch into the car. Somehow in the 10 minute hell-ride to the dog park, the transformation happened... You saw what you saw. I smiled graciously and thanked you. But I know better... now you know too.",6
"I don't feel comfortable with my parents watching my 15mo old son. I'm 100% comfortable with my in laws watching him, but my parents really make questionable decisions with the baby WHEN I'M THERE. For example, not holding onto him to the point where he almost fell and I had to catch him, putting him on a restaurant table to try to see him crawl, and the list goes on. Even more, my dad was physically abusive when I was a child to me and my siblings. He's much better now, and I have a good relationship with him now, but the worry is there. Beyond that, a relative accused him of sexually molesting him when they were both kids which scares me. It was during a fight over my grandparents estate and was clearly meant to have a gigantic impact, though I know my siblings and I were never assaulted in that way (we talked about it after). On the other hand I am not one to discount stories like that lightly. I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings but I am in no way comfortable with them babysitting and I feel like it's coming to a point where I need to stop making excuses and just tell them I'm not ok with it. Has anyone had anything similar?†",6
"I don't know how it happened. I don't know what went wrong. I tried my best, my very, very best. Swear to God! I've made a conscious effort to instill good values in my daughter, who is three and a half now. I've done what I could to lead by example, developing good habits and routines in our daily family life. Often, my wife objected, but I stood my ground. One does not compromise on the important things - and this is as important as it gets. But yesterday, at the breakfast table, it hit me. My failure. After all this work, I've failed. My almost daily efforts, an abject failure. A complete and utter waste, all this work. As I tried to coax, trick and force her to eat all of her bun of which she had only ingested a couple of bites, the truth, cold and hard, was staring me in the face: She simply does not like Nutella.

"I don't know what to do! I've tried it all. She will only eat scrambled eggs, plain noodles, plain rice, apples, grilled cheese, and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. That is it! I am so tired of having to cook a meal for me and a separate meal for her. Now I know what you're thinking, that I must be too soft-hearted, and that I'm giving in too easily when she asks for what she likes instead of what I made.
But I'm not. I have tried letting her go hungry until she eats whatever I made, but it doesn't work. She did not eat for THREE DAYS. Of course, I gave in at that point, she was so sluggish and exhausted, and was starting to get sick. The first two days of those three, I even made her sit at the table without getting up unless she ate her food (I say ate, but I told her she could get up if she just ate ONE BITE). She sat there for 12 hours straight both days, just getting up to go to the restroom. Would not even take one bite. The third day I tried not making her sit at the table and just offered the food whenever she asked for something to eat.
I am in tears from writing this, I just don't know what to do. If she doesn't learn to eat healthy things as a child how will she ever be a healthy adult?",1
"I don't know what to do. My 10 week old (who cluster feeds practically every day) refuses to take anything except a real nipple. No pacies and no bottles. She's taken one bottle of breast milk ever and that was from my mom because I was gone longer than I've ever been for a holiday thing. All other pumped milk has gone to waste. We've tried several kinds of bottles and pacifiers but they all just make her mad. When I see people talk about taking any kind of time away from their kid- I just have no idea how to do it. My husband had me go get a pedicure last weekend because I hadn't really had any time away from her. She was ok for a short while until she got hungry and then screamed and screamed til I came home and wouldn't take a bottle. I just don't know what to do. I want to start working out a few times a week and have even started interviewing babysitters, but I don't think it's going to work. She just won't take a bottle. She also uses me as her pacifier to calm herself down even when she's not hungry. I love that I'm able to spend my time with her and she's so bonded to me, but I need to find a way to make her comfortable with me being gone an hour or two every once in a while.

"I feel like all the things I need to be doing right now are at cross purposes and I just don't know how to handle it!
DD is 8.5 months. She's never taken a bottle (lipase issues earlier and now just refuses to drink from anything other than the boob), she eats solids like a champ, nurses around every 2.5-3 hours during the day but only for 5 or 6 minutes at a time, and wakes up usually twice a night for a feed.
The things I want to accomplish soon (largely because I'm going back to work) are:
* make sure she's not nursing to sleep for naps
* night wean 
* teach her to take a bottle 
* make sure she's getting the recommended 20oz of milk a day
The current schedule is 6 or 7 am wake up, nurse, pump to make cereal, feed cereal, play, nap 9 or 10 for an hour or so, nurse, play, lunch at 12, play, nurse just before nap at 2ish, wake up 3ish, play, nurse 5ish, dinner 6ish, bath, nurse, bed at 7:30.
The way I see it, if I stop feeding her at night that means she needs to nurse more often during the day in order to squeeze in those 20oz, but if I'm not nursing her immediately before naps I need to find other times during the day, but she's just not hungry enough to eat a dozen times a day! So am I supposed to cut back on meals of solids so that I can nurse her more often? And when am I supposed to find time to try teaching her to take a bottle so she doesn't starve when I go back to work?
I just don't understand how there's enough time in the day to get 20oz of nursing done as well as 3 meals of solids, without nursing to sleep for naps.
If you have a daily schedule that works, I'd love to hear it! Thanks!",6

I'm going through a divorce and I'm depressed. I am getting treatment but it hasn't been all that effective. My son is 3 years old and Ive been depressed for most of his life. My underlying condition mixed with the stress and uncertainty of divorce has made me a really bitter, toxic person. And, honestly, I don't like being with my son at all. I let him watch tv all day and try to sleep. I let him eat whatever he wants because I'm too tired to fight with him. I let him stay in his pjs until we absolutely have to leave the house. I rarely feel like I connect with or engage him. He constantly says things like, 'I don't want to have 2 homes' and 'I don't want to live with you, just daddy'. It breaks my heart and I just can't deal with it anymore. I'm seriously considering giving full custody to my ex and only seeing my son every other weekend. I feel like it is best for him to have a stable home, even if it isn't with me. This also makes me feel like I am abandoning him and inviting judgement from my ex and my family.

"I feel like my children are just NOT sleepers. Maybe they're vampires, I don't know. My older son is 5 now but when he was a baby, he was up every 1-2 hours for a VERY long time. I breastfed him for 4 weeks and during those 4 weeks, he would eat for an hour, sleep for an hour, all day every day. It was exhausting. So I gave up and switched to formula so dad could help takeover some feedings. He STILL barely slept and would be up all the time. Even if he did fall asleep, he'd wake up screaming the moment you put him in his crib. As he got older, he stopped waking up frequently, but he would still wake up 1-2 times at night, just to ask for water or a toy or something silly and I'd have to put him back to bed. That lasted up until recently and he still wakes up once at night to go to the bathroom usually, but he'll just go and put himself back in bed now. 
Well I just had baby #2 in August. I'm still breastfeeding her at 6 months and overall, things are going well. But she just will not sleep! We co-slept up until recently and it was a little bit easier on me since I didn't have to fully"" wake up to feed her. She would just lay next to me and feed as she wanted  we set her crib up in her own room  right next to us  and the wake ups went from 6x/night down to maybe 3x/night It's very frustrating.

"I feel so lost. I had to take him to the ER, though the benadryl we were able to give him kicked in just before we got there and eased his throat swelling. His hives and swelling were another story. 
Anyway, the doctor I took him to said the blood test for nut allergies is only 70-80% accurate, so it's more of a 'guide'... so, even though he's tested 'severely allergic' to wanuts, pecans, cashews and hazelnuts and mildly allergic to brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, pistaschios and peanuts, he may not actually be allergic to any of those (well, obviously he's allergic to cashews. i'm pretty sure of it, anyway, so i'm not taking any chances)... anyway. where do i start?? do i go through every single thing in our pantry and read the label and try to make an 'educated guess' as to whether to toss it or not? apparently he's allergic to just about every tree nut out there and half the stuff we have in our snack pantry is made in a 'plant that processes other tree nuts'. 
i'm really trying not to panic... we have 2 epi pens that we now carry with us and keep at home and will probably get another prescription to keep at his school.

My 3yo isn't a bad kid but of course he has his moments, and he doesn't understand things like no mommy can't just put the baby down""  ""no honey you can't play with that right now (some loud toy) I'm trying to get the baby to sleep"" and that mommy doesn't have the one-on-one time anymore He has gotten VERY VERY clingy too as if he wasn't already clingy before  which really exacerbates my problems... Mealtimes aren't on time  and they're sometimes just snacks and I feel awful about that too.  And then there's the usual stuff...  chores not getting done etc...  But yesterday  like it's just too much on my plate.  I always thought I wanted three or even four but holy hell this month has really made me doubt that. Is it just me or is it normal to feel so frustrated all the time after going from one to two kids?  Does it get better? Today my cousin took my 3yo out for the afternoon...  fuck did I ever need that.  But I don't always have her to ask and don't have much other help other than my husband  who works full time.  So sometimes I feel very ""solo"" and I'm not even getting outside for fresh air cause I'm too busy changing diapers and being a feed bag.  It's not healthy being cooped up in the house I really don't know what to do about it all.  I feel like I'm not cut out for this at all.""",2

"I found a way to have your kids clean the bathtub while being creative and having fun! Create your own washable bathtub paints with stuff from your house that will clean your bathtub:
[You will need:](http://imgur.com/MzYrj,or9Vr#0) 
Corn Starch
Clear soap (hand soap or dish soap will work)
Food coloring
Small dishes or ice tray
Each color gets its own dish or spot in the ice tray. 
Each color needs:
2-3 tablespoons of the clear soap
1/2-1 tablespoons of cornstarch
4-6 drops of food coloring
Pour the clear soap into container, then add the corn starch. Add 4-6 drops of food color and stir well.
I made red, yellow, green, blue, and tried to make purple but it turned out blackish. No worries, it still works!
Give your child the bath paints and a brush. They will have a blast making art all over the bath wall. 
When they are done with the bath, have them use a washcloth to erase"" the paintings
These paints are completely washable safe for septic tanksEnjoy! I Think I need to call child services on my sister in law I need some advice.""",6
I found this recipe that I wanted to share with you guys.  [It's a little octopus!](http://spoonful.com/recipes/garden-octopus) :D,4
"I gave my 6 month old son a Gerber teething biscuit this morning. He only ate half of it so I popped the other half in my mouth, and promptly crunched down on a piece of glass. Disturbing, right? Called the Gerber hotline and they are sending someone out next week to pick up the box of biscuits and the pieces of glass. Called the pediatrician and they said just to watch baby's stools for blood in case he ate a piece too. He seems fine thankfully. Just wanted to let my fellow parents know! We already stopped using jarred baby food because of concerns over lead content. Guess we need to start making our own teething biscuits too, anyone got a good recipe?
TL;DR - Found glass in Gerber teething biscuit.",6
"I get so hungry when nursing! I have this huge stash of nutri-grain bars, trail mix, crackers and other crumbly snacks in my nightstand drawer so I can snack while breastfeeding in the mornings and other times when baby girl is in her bassinet in our room. Well I absolutely hate crumbs in the bed; so I eat on husbands side of the bed or hold my head and the hand thats holding the food over his side. I'm terrible! He hasn't said anything about the crumbs but has asked why I feel the need to wash the sheets so much. I just blame it on the need to keep it clean for baby not the fact that every night I wake up in a huge puddle of breast-milk and everyday leave a huge pile of crumbs!†",6
"I had a beautiful daughter 4-1/2 years ago, divorced about a 1-1/2 years ago and moved an hour away.  I commute to work every day so my daughter can go to the same daycare, and hope to move soon (within the next few months) back to where I moved from.  My ex-husband and I have joint custody of our daughter, he has her 3 nights a week (Wed-Fri) and I have her 4 nights (Sat-Tues).
My daughter goes to daycare Monday-Thursday 7:30am to 5:00pm; and is with my mother on Fridays to cut back on daycare costs because it is so expensive.
I do not talk to my parents because they HATE my current boyfriend, they say I left my ex-husband for him ‚Äì they even went to his work and got in his face and called him a ‚Äòcoward‚Äô and a ‚Äòbastard‚Äô.  This has caused a HUGE riff in our relationship.
So here is my dilemma‚Ä¶. My ex-husband, because he lives within a few minutes of my parent‚Äôs house, drops off my daughter right after daycare on Thursdays and leaves her for a sleep over, then she‚Äôs there all day on Friday, then most weeks stays there on Friday nights as well.  He then tries to be sneaky and drops her off with me and doesn‚Äôt say anything about it, and I find out from my daughter after she starts talking about it.
Because of her constant sleepovers and her realizing that she can ‚Äúwork the system‚Äù, my daughter is getting spoiled ROTTEN, so when I bring her home on Saturday afternoons, she SCREAMS and throws fits when I tell her she can‚Äôt have candy or a snack right before dinner, or can‚Äôt have ice cream because she didn‚Äôt finish her meal.
How do I approach my parents and tell them to stop the sleepovers when I do not talk to them more than maybe once a month, and what is the acceptable number of sleepovers with Grandparents for a 4 year old?
tl;dr: ex-husband takes his 2 out of 3 nights and leaves my daughter with my parents (who I don‚Äôt talk to) instead of spending the evenings with her, which in turn leaves her spoiled rotten.  
Edit: I've tried talking to my ex about it, and he has told me It's none of your business what I do with my time.""""",6
I had a doctors appointment for my twins today and it went well. My boy Zev is 10.8 lbs and my girl Zola is 9.3 lbs. Is that the normal weight for preemie babies at three months old?

Did you simply ask the doctor, or was it something else, like going into labor sooner than your c-section date? Any advice would be awesome.",6
"I had heard these banana and egg pancakes mentioned a number of times so decided to give them a go.  I was pleasantly surprised by how they turned out.  They were quite soft but did hold their shape and my 10 month old enjoyed them.Ingredients:2 eggs1 bananaMethod:‚Ä¢Whisk ingredients together until well combined. I used a stick blender.‚Ä¢Cook as you would a normal pancake but make them quite small.  I used 1 tablespoon of mixture per pancake. I also added some cinnamon and I imagine other additions would work well too.

"I had my baby a week ago (July 17th 2012) and since I'm breastfeeding it seems like my husband isn't doing squat to help me care for the baby.  
I usually change his diaper before or after a feeding and it doesn't make sense to have my husband wake up just to change the diaper when I'm going to be up to feed him anyway, yet, I'm resentful in a way because he's getting to sleep for hours on end when I am not.
I feel like since he's not doing much for the baby, he should be doing more around the house and he's not doing that either.  He's playing on his computer and acting like I'm nagging him all the time when I ask him to do little things for me here and there.
What can I do to motivate his ass?",6
"I had my baby in May and have gained even more since I had her. I'm 5'3 250 lbs and very depressed about it. I'm over it!

I don't plan on doing any fad diets, just being more active and making better choices eating. Let me know!",6
"I had my IUD put in five months ago, and this is the first birth control I have been successfully on. I became pregnant twice on the nuvaring & a low dose b.c. Pill. I had my second baby eight months ago, and had lost every bit of my baby weight with some exercise, healthy food, and breast feeding. Now, I have gained ten pounds **PAST** my DELIVERY weight, even though I have continued to exercise and eat healthy. I am still breast feeding, and I have talked to my doctor about it. His only option was to take out the mirena and risk another pregnancy! I'm all done for a looooooooong time, if ever again. Has anyone else had this problem? We're you able to take off the weight?",6
"I hate being a mom right now. I'm tired frustrated and angry. I don't want to change another diaper, wake up from a nice sleep only to have to struggle to breast feed. Why on earth we decided to have another baby is now beyond me. She was so good at first, now she is a pain. I just want to sleep. I want to be able to pick up my first born (c section not allowed to lift him) I want to stop grasping at straws and crying about everything. I am just doing this now because I am supposed to take care of this squirming larva. Plus the family (who do not have to be up with her every 3 hours only to have her fail at breast feeding and pooping in the diaper I had just put on her) seems to like her and probably wouldn't like it if I gave her away. To clarify as well I would not hurt her in any way. I don't want to feel this way but I do. Had to vent. Maybe someone knows this feeling too. Edit: these feelings happen at night usually. And while many things can set me off crying during the day it is short lived and doesn't prevent me from caring for myself and children. I talked to the doctor today she says at this point it sounds like normal baby blues. If it prevents me from getting out of bed. Wanting to go out of the house or if my moods become worse to let her know. I felt pretty much te same with my first and it passed once sleep was reintroduced to my brains. As for naps for some reason I have always had an aversion to naps. Especially now with a toddler running amok. I have often tried to nap. It just cannot happen. Bottle feeding even breast milk I want to hold off on until I see the lactation consultant. That way she has the best chance she can have for continuing to breast feed and not preferring the bottle.",6
"I have 3 weeks of vacation every year. We usually do one week all together and a few 4 day weekends. Then there are my secret days off. 

Secret days off are days where my bf goes to work and my daughter goes to school and I schedule the day off without telling anyone. Sometimes I go through the effort of getting dressed and leave for work"" which is just me going to have breakfast at a diner until they're gone. Breakfast is wonderful because I'm not entertaining a 5 year old who doesn't even stop talking when she has a mouth full of food and trying to engage my bf in conversation. I'm not rushed because I'm the slowest eater. When they leave I go back home and get into my snuggly jammies. I climb back in bed and catch up on my dvr. At some point (still in jammies) I get some ""stinky"" Chinese food to eat at home without having to hear ""your food smells"". Then I watch a little maury and maybe some dancing around. I read books and maybe nap. At 5 I get back into my work clothes and pick her up from school (she's too observant and would rat me out if I showed up in jammies).  I don't get out much outside of these secret days off so they are magical for me. I've gone 3 years without being caught. Here's to 2015 having some uneventful unproductive secret days off!""",6
"I have 4 children and most of them grown up. I am more than likely the age of your mothers. Tonight my 23 year old (who still lives with me because my house is huge and I would get lonely), comes home from work. I had made salmon loaf and a salad for dinner and it was ready when he came in the house. He isn't hungry. Then he says he is meeting a friend at a local market, so he leaves. Then the calls begin. He wants me to make him a corned beef and cabbage. But he doesn't want just any corned beef, he wants it from scratch. And he imagines that I can make this in the pressure cooker. Corned beef from scratch takes a week, just to brine the meat. Sadly, he knows I can make it. I don't have part of the brining ingredients on hand. He begins to call and text, asking what I need, then he gets irritated and won't answer the phone when I call him back. He comes home from the market with $30 worth of USDA choice brisket, one head of cabbage and a bag of red potatoes. That's all. He flings the brisket on the kitchen counter and says do what you want with it. So I brown the brisket †and throw that in the pressure cooker with water and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix. I cut up some potatoes for mash and set them on the stove with some water. I can hear the pressure cooker down there making its hissing noises right now. He is not going to get any food until about 10 PM †because he came back at 7:45. I am not complaining!†Because as someone that is on the other end of where you all with babies are... I love the holy living hell out of my kids. I see what all the hard work has produced. I see the kids that work hard have gone to school learn new things every day the kids that I taught to read and †forced to practice their instruments. And I finally see what all that hard work is for.†I have seen them pull away gradually on their way to adulthood and it was painful at times watching them make stupid mistakes. Bringing down the hammer on discipline. Letting them take responsibility for their actions. I have watched them become individuals. They surely didn't turn out like I expected in any way and honestly. But sometimes a kid of mine wants dinner. Another kid will call me and ask me how I made that incredible pot roast or chicken. One of them will call and ask how to get out a stain from a work shirt. And I know that until my last breath. Being a parent is a 24/7 full time career. And sometimes when you are in the thick of it. So the next time you are walking the floor with a colicky baby or wiping the spit up off that dress that has to be dry cleaned. It's over in an instant *I swear it.* You will be so busy you won't even notice the passage of time. But every story you read to them and they will still look to you for support and comfort. You won't be forgotten. So do your best every day! ",6
"I have 4 month old twins, they are not breastfed anymore. The boy has absolutely no appetite. He usually gets 5 bottles a day of porridge made with a lot of milk(as to raise amount of calories).Out of the 5 bottles, he usually only drinks one completely. With the other 4, we have to struggle for him to eat half. Each bottle has about 120ml and 125 calories, so he's typically getting less than 400 calories a day. He's gaining less than 100g/week. His pediatrician doesn't seem to think too much of it.

"I have a 2 and 5 yr old and find mealtimes to be one of the more frustrating times of days.  I have a few questions:

1. how long do you give your kids to eat a meal?  I don't want to raise stressed out rushed kids, but I don't want mealtimes to last forever either.  I also dont' know how long the 5 year old will get for lunch once he starts kindergarten in a few weeks and want to get him used to the time frame.

2.  How much silliness do you tolerate?  When they are both at the table they seem to spend most of the time distracting each other and doing anything but eating, which contributes to problem number 1.  By silliness I mean playing with silverware, making silly noises, and doing all sorts of nonsense.

"I have a 2.5 year old toddler who currently eats: all fruits, peanuts, frozen blueberries (this is a must for breakfast), whole milk, cherry tomatoes, baby carrot sticks, and yogurt.  She struggles to eat much of anything else.  how can i expand her diet?  On any given day, she would be more than happy to eat fruit and milk all day long.  She started off with a much more diverse palate.. i used to make her babyfood and she was not picky at all!  However.. as all good things must come to an end, I had to go back to work and things have steadily gone downhill.  Any input is appreciated!
ETA:  Thanks for all your advice!  Cara is currently getting one sippy cup of milk in the midmorning for a snack and one after dinner before bedtime.  I'd say they're between 8-10 oz each time.  Is that too much?  I have tried putting 2 normal foods and 1 new one but she usually won't even let her normal food touch the new one LOL.  I have noticed that she tends to shy away from tangy foods like pickles.  
She is also a weirdy... doesn't like mashed potatoes.. =[  i'm stuck there because she refuses to eat it.  I will definitely try out the allowing her to help me cook.  Currently, I am using bribery but it's very hit and miss.  Maybe I will up the bribery?  ",2

"I have a 4 and 3 year old, and we are expecting our third in may(Yay!). I been doing some research on car seats to see what is going to work for us and our car. I've figure that the Dino Radian will probably work best for us(unless both my kids can switch to boosters then I don't even have to worry about any of it) because it fits three seats across, from what I've seen, in all cars. 
I was wondering though if its ok for new borns? I know the minimum weight for these car seats are 5 pounds, and I'm not too worried about our next baby being close to that. So is it good as long as the baby meets the weight requirement? Or is it more for children a little older(3+ months)? 
I'm sorry if these are silly questions, I've tried looking around to see but haven't found anything about new borns. I didn't have to worry about with my two others because I just bought/had an infant car seat then we bought the bigger ones as needed. Thanks ahead of time for any help/info!",6
"I have a 4 month old son who I love to pieces.  He is the source of so much joy, pride, happiness, and laughter for my husband and I.  We have been together for 10 years and married for 1.5 years.  We always knew we would be this family one day, but took our time growing up and maturing until we were exactly where we wanted to be in order to give our future children everything that we wanted them to have.  I regret nothing about the path we have chosen... except that I regret everything.  The time we took to become who we are now was crucial.  This is exactly the way my life was always supposed to be.  My husband is my best friend, and after spending 1/3 of my life with him, I couldn't imagine it any other way.  
My mom passed away two weeks ago.  She was 61 years old and died of melanoma.  Ten years ago she had melanoma skin cancer removed.  Three years ago she had part of her lung removed due to a melanoma tumor.  At that time she and my dad realized what was coming.  Last August the melanoma showed back up as tumors in her abdomen.  She tried several grueling and tortuous treatments, some that a lot of patients don't even live through.  She fought on fearlessly and never complained.  I was pregnant at the time and the info shared with me was edited"" to say the least.  They were protecting their first grandbaby by keeping me calm and healthy.  My mom answered every crazy pregnant phone call and supported me in every way a daughter could ask her mother to support her pregnancy.  She was just out of the hospital in between treatments when she came to my baby shower which she helped plan. My son was born on January 1 and my parents came to the hospital in tuxedos with champagne!  According to my dad ""how else are you supposed to greet a New Year's baby?""  They were head over heels for Wesley.  He was everything and more that we were waiting for. While I was home on maternity leave my mom was hospitalized again.  This time she was there for a few weeks and I took Wesley to see his Nannie every afternoon.  We sat and talked  but I didn't realize how serious the situation was at the time.  She was so calm and resolved that it just never occurred to me that we were running out of time.  Wesley was 3 1/2 months old when she passed. They didn't get a lot of time together but they had quality time.  She took us to his first pediatrician's appointment  he had his first belly laugh in her lap  and he smiled that big silly baby smile whenever he saw her. Two weeks ago we went to Florida for a family vacation some quality time while we still could.  My parents arrived on Saturday and Wesley and I flew in on Sunday.  All Sunday afternoon and evening we sat with her while I read to Wesley and we played.  Her mind was coming and going and she was struggling to breathe.  It took all she had to get a few words out when we would ask if she was in pain or needed anything.  But I started this post by saying that I don't regret the path my life has taken and I don't.  But I can't help but feel guilty that I took so much time being a self centered college student and then working my way up getting my career going.  I could have gotten him here years ago and they would have had time together So  I will struggle like every new mom does and I will learn my lessons the hard way like we all do.  And at the end of the day I will quietly think about the lady who would have taken my phone call and listened while I complained about day care or night time feedings or whatever trivial thing I was worried about.  Then I will turn my attitude around be the kind of mom that she was",6

"I have a 5 month old little lady, and generally she's an alright sleeper.  Things got haywire during her 4 month sleep regression, which I think is over?, but now when she wakes, or semi wakes during the night she raises both of her legs and then slams them against the bassinet. She repeats this until she is good and awake and crying.  I generally feed her and then try to cosleep with her but she just kicks me all night.  If I put her back in the bassinet she just starts thrashing and crying.  I am at my wits end. I'm dangerously tired.
I've seen that many other parents go through this, but I haven't seen any solutions.  I am about to start swaddling her again, even though she can roll over. The first time she did it last night I gently held down her legs until she calmed down and went back to deep sleep, but it didn't work a second time.

"I have a daughter that will be 4 months old in 6 days.  I'm the father.
My wife works 40+ hour weeks in a salaried positiion which requires her to travel around the state, and when necessary stay away for a night or longer.  Her travel isn't really relevant to my question, but I figured it best to let you know somewhat what her work day is like.
A couple times now my wife has mentioned supplementing our daughters diet with formula, which I'm against.  It's already hard enough  to get our daughter to eat from the breast unless she's sleeping, since with a bottle the milk is ready to go, and sometimes the boob it isn't.  Our daughter has been eating from bottles for about a month now pretty regularly.  We had trouble getting her to regularly take a bottle initially.  I'm against it cause I'm afraid that giving her the option, she'll decide she only wants formula, or will eat from the boob less, and sooner rather than later the milk supply will run dry.
It seems that the two or three times she has mentioned this has been when our daughter seems to be having a growth spurt and eats 25% more than a normal day (yesterday and today she ate about 25 ounces, where she normally eats 20ish), so I'm not really sure how to handle the situation.  If I stick with what I believe will happen if we introduce formula, then I'm being an asshole, but if I feel this way and don't say anything, then I'm being a schmuck.

"I have a six and a half year old daughter. In many ways she is typical for her age. She gets praised for doing good things (finishing her homework, playing well with others, being polite) and scolded for doing bad things (fighting with other children, not doing her chores, not listening to mommy and daddy). The problem is she doesn't seem to care too much about either positive or negative reinforcement and because of that I'm not sure how to apply carrot or stick.
For example, on the carrot"" side she knows that if she does all of her homework and all of her chores during the week  and even little things like picking what she wants for dinner or having a dessert when it's not ""dessert night"" at the house. 99 times out of 100 when she doesn't earn the carrot she gives a little ""awwwww"" and that's about it. On the ""stick"" side if she misbehaves enough for a time-out  she basically shrugs So what do you do when neither carrot nor stick has any meaningful long-term impact on your child's behavior?""",1
"I have a soon to be 18 year old daughter who is very clingy and expects a lot from me. Aside from going to school she occasionally volunteers at an animal shelter and spends the rest of her time at home or with her boyfriend.
Even though we live in a big city with good public transportation she expects me to drive her everywhere, if I don‚Äôt drive her where she wants to go, most of the time she just won‚Äôt go. She just got her driver‚Äôs license and wants me to either buy her a car or let her drive mine, which I won‚Äôt. I think that she should get a part-time job and save up for the expenses associated with driving if she wants to drive. There are days that I just don‚Äôt feel like cooking dinner and she gets upset because there isn‚Äôt a cooked meal in the house. She would rather go to bed hungry than cook herself a meal (she knows how to cook). Aside from this, she is a good kid.
Most of my daughter‚Äôs friends (in my opinion) are babied by their parents and feel entitled. Their parents take care of everything for them. Some of them graduated a few years ago and still live with their parents while their parents do everything for them. Here is an example, my sister in law who is in her late 20s graduated college years ago, she has a good job and a child of her own. She still lives with her parents rent free while her parents do everything for her and her daughter (including their laundry), and she goes and parties every weekend while her parents take care of her child. This is disgusting to me. 
When I was growing my parents didn‚Äôt take care of much for me. They had the attitude that their responsibility was to provide me and my siblings with the basics and anything else was extra and they didn‚Äôt have to do anything else. We needed to figure things out on our own. I moved out of my parent‚Äôs house when I was young.  I worked, had my own place, bought my own car and didn‚Äôt ask my parents for a thing after I moved out. My daughter doesn‚Äôt understand this and thinks my parents were cruel. 
Just wondering how other parents feel about this. How much involvement should a parent have when their children get older?

I have a two year old daughter that is an extremely picky eatter . I do have taking vitemins ..... I have her for one week then her dad has her for the next week so any idea's  have to bare this is mind. What I have tried for her is making pictures with her meals. I have cut vegys up into small pieces and stuck them into her noddles. Mr.noodles is the only noodles she will eat and she figured out what I was doing and spit it back out. I have took the only things she will actually eat and refused to give them to her for the one week. She really tried to go that week without eatting. So I don't want to do that again. I have made my own food and put it into wrappers to make it seem like its candy still didn't work.  She will not eat any sauces at all so these are out. As same with gravy. Had her stay at the table until she at least tried a bit and she gagged her self instead. Now is this something I will just have to grin and bare until she gets older or does anyone have a great idea? ,1
"I have a two-and-a-half year old daughter - and unfortunately I also have ulcerative colitis.

She has a great attitude towards food, and it's important that we all sit down together each night and eat the same thing. She would still eat the same food as her dad, but my food would be different.

This friend is everything I do not want my daughter to be. She is snotty. I'm sorry but that would be the easiest way to put it. She is also very jealous when it comes to my daughter having other friends. The first day of school my daughter came home to inform me that A had begged"" her so hard to switch binders ( A liked my daughter's binder better)  very happy and caring she just bends over backwards for this little girl in all the wrong ways. Just in the short convo A's mom and I had at open house she informs me she cooks A a seperate meal most nights for dinner because she doesn't ""like"" what mom is making AND A dictates what days her mother goes to the gym based on the daycare teacher that will be there that night because that is the one A likes. My daughter comes home with 'snob' stories about A almost daily. There are just so many things I see wrong with this situation.  Her mom wants to ""get together"". A always wants my daughter to come over.  My old self would just ignore her mother until I run into her somewhere then just blatantly tell her that her kid's a brat and I don't want me or my child around it.

"I have an eight-year-old son. He's generally very healthy. He eats well (eats *a lot* most of the time, and is always asking me for snacks), he's growing like a weed, he has a ton of energy and is just overall an awesome little dude. The last four or five months, though, he keeps having these bouts of what looks like 24-hour stomach flu. He will wake up in the wee morning hours, barf a time or two, and sometimes have diarrhea either immediately following the vomiting or several hours later, when he wakes up for the day. It clears up quickly - by dinner time he's always fine. He has no other symptoms - no rash, no fever, no headache. And his sister never gets sick with these symptoms, which is odd because normally stomach flus are very contagious and these two do everything together.
Does anyone have any similar experiences? I don't know what to do. I don't know if it's serious or just a rough patch. We homeschool, and for a long time he didn't have all that much exposure to other kids (long story, unfortunate living situation, etc.). We've moved, though, and he's been around other kids more in the last couple months than he had for quite a long time previously. I'm not sure if maybe he's just finally getting exposed to more normal childhood infections. In general, he does seem to get sick more readily than his sister - she has a really good immune system, and often when the two of them get sick she doesn't get as sick and she recovers faster. Maybe he's just more susceptible. But I can't shake the fear that it's something else. I don't know if he needs to be seen by a doctor and tested. It probably can't hurt.
Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks guys!",6

I love what has become known as 'Pig Slop' in my house. It's stove top stuffing, chicken broth/cream of chicken soup, and whatever veggies you have on hand that your family likes. Ours usually gets corn, green beans and peas. Sometimes Lima or butter beans.  It takes about 20min to make and I don't have to thaw or prep anything. ",4

"I have had a history of depression and anxiety since I was 11. I had managed to shake a longish cycle of depression and lost a bunch of weight before I got pregnant with my son, because I wanted my body and mind to be ready for a baby. I was expecting PPD, and started seeing a therapist two weeks after my son was born. Except, it never went away. Four years later, and I'm still depressed. I've seen therapists on and off, and I'm currently on Wellbutrin with no spectacular effects. I've gained almost all my extra weight back.
At this point, I am actually starting to feel better and get more motivated. I'm working on losing weight. My husband and I were planning on having two kids, around 3 years apart. My depression and grad school have made us miss that boat, since our son is almost four. But, what about trying to get pregnant again once I get down to my goal weight?
The problem is, I'm so afraid I'm going to get my mind right again, and then the PPD is going to come back for another five years. I don't think I can handle that. I mean, there's a good chance I will relapse at some point in the future, but it won't be because of something I consciously chose to do. I don't resent my son, but I definitely feel like I my mind and body would be doing better today if I hadn't had him. I do get defensive whenever I see my friends on Facebook having more children. That was supposed to be me, but now I feel like I have no choice. I feel like someone has told me I'm infertile. This is not how it was supposed to be.
So, I want to know if anyone else struggled with Postpartum Depression. Did it affect your choice to have more children? Did you experience it again if you had more children?",6
"I have had three children. Ages 2,1, and 2 weeks. My two year old had constipation problems from the time he was born. First they thought it was a milk allergy, then a soy allergy, maybe celiac disease, or food protein induced enterocolitis syndrome, and finally they said he has a dairy allergy. The same thing happened with my 1 year old. She had the same exact problems with the same symptoms. Neither kids could handle formula. We've tried every kind. Every brand. They both got constipated to the point that both of them have been on miralax for almost their entire lives because of the constipation. Juice didn't help. Noting helped. I decided to breastfeed my newborn after he showed the same signs as his siblings when we fed him formula. We were supplementing at night and while I was at work because I can't afford an automatic pump. Right now I can barely afford diapers. My manual pump isn't helping at all. I barely get milk out. I know I have milk because I leak a lot and I breastfeed him and he's fat and happy lol Long story short, I quit breastfeeding completely yesterday. It's been 2 days since he's had breastmilk and he's constipated. Bad. I've given him juice and lubed up my finger and helped him poop it out (I'm an EMT. I won't hurt my baby. I'm just helping him. Please don't get the wrong idea. When it gets stuck I help lube the outside and gently push so it's easier to get out). Has anyone else had this issue?? With 3 children having the exact same problem and the exact same reactions to formula, there has to be a medical reason. Doctors can't figure out what's causing my sons constipation. Considering my newborn can handle breastmilk and poop normally but two days off it constipated him, there has to be something I can do. My heart is broken because I'm hoping it's not too late to find an automatic pump and start breastfeeding again. My boobs are still leaking and they're not hard and engorged so I know I have milk. I don't know what to do :( tl;dr newborn is constipated because of formula and I stopped breastfeeding. Don't know what to do. Worried it's too late to find an automatic pump somehow and start breastfeeding again.†",6
"I have no idea if this is the right subreddit to put this, so if it belongs somewhere else please tell me and I will move it. This just seems like the right place to me. I recently became acquainted with a lady via a mutual friend of ours. She seems very nice and all but literally all I know about her is her name and that she has a special needs baby (unsure of what kind of special needs). For the sake of context, I and the rest of the people mentioned here are between the ages of 19 and 25. None of us besides the lady in question have children and from what I understand she is a single mother. Saturday evening I visited this lady and her roommate with my bf and aforementioned mutual friend for an Easter party. There was an approximate attendance of twenty people and drinks were provided. At one point everyone went outside to play with the roommate's new puppy and throw a football around. As we were leaving I noticed the baby was strapped into a Bumbo sat on the kitchen table. She was completely alone and her mom was nowhere to be seen. No one else was in the house. I pointed this out to my bf and he said it was no big deal and went outside with everyone. I opted to stay inside. I pulled up a chair and waited around with the baby for ~5 minutes thinking maybe her mom would come back for her. She did not. I do not know this woman very well and I have only ever interacted with her baby once before, however I was not comfortable leaving her alone so I did something I would not normally do and picked her up. She seemed ok with me so I carried her around and eventually went looking for her mom. She was outside with the rest of the party throwing eggs at each other in the park across the road. I went out to join them with the baby - keeping in mind it has at this point been half an hour and this baby was completely alone, unfed, and with an obviously soiled diaper. After another ~15 minutes the mom noticed me and came over. She said she was going to feed the baby and took her from me. That was the only exchange we had before they both went back inside. I did not see the baby again, however the mom was around and socializing with friends for the rest of the night. My bf and our mutual friend do not seem to care or find this unusual. My question is: do I have any real need to be concerned or am I overreacting? I have no experience with babies and do not want to cause unnecessary drama if I am in the wrong. If this is something that I should worry about, what do I do? I have no evidence that this happened - no pictures, no video, nothing - and I barely know this woman or her family. I do not want to upset anyone or draw attention to myself but I am genuinely concerned for this baby. EDIT: I've taken everyone's advice and am getting in contact with CPS.

"I have to give a bit of back story here.
17666,In January of 2010 I had my son(5 days overdue @ 6 pounds 9 and half oz). Before we left the hospital he was down to just 6 pounds, and by the time we got to his first pediatrician appointment he was down to 5 pounds 9oz.
17667,For 2 weeks I breastfed exclusively because it was all my abusive/controlling SO would allow. I was nursing for 4+ hours at a time, and he would still be crying and trying to latch whenever I stopped. I would pump or do manually express when he was sleeping to try to get ahead/produce more, but I never got more than 1/2 oz on each side even at my most engorged.
17668,I finally took a picture of my son while we were bathing him that clearly showed just how skeletal he had become since we brought him home, and my SO finally decided we could supplement formula.
17669,My son finally started gaining weight consistently, drinking 8 oz bottles like nobody's business even in the early months, although he was still below average in weight/height.
17670,He started teething around 5 months, and there was a short time where he was uninterested in even drinking. Then when teeth started cutting rapid fire he would drink but didn't want to eat.
17671,His pediatrician said it was normal, and he might even lose a little weight.
17672,By the time he was 1 he had tried every kind of baby food, and we were blending our own meats/family meals for him to have ect...
17673,We were both unemployed during my pregnancy/his first 8 months of life.
17674,Here is where things get very... shitty.
17675,I got a job working 8 hours Mon-Fri, which left my SO at home being Mr. Mom, except he would drink ALL night, EVERY night, and sleep all day. When I came home in the evenings I would find that my son hadn't been fed all day except for milk/juice and crackers which he gave to him randomly through out the day. He would gate him into his room and I wasn't allowed to go near him/interact with him, I was forced to sit and watch him drink. When I did get to interact with my son it was usually within the first 2 hours after getting home and would be spent trying to convince him to eat something that wasn't crackers, and giving him a bath.
17676,
17677,I have since left his Father, got physical/legal custody, left the state, and he only gets supervised visitation if I return to the area where he lives or if he comes here...
17678,
17679,Now my son is nearly 2 years old(8 days away) and we are still having issues with food and weight. When I got full custody and left my son was just barely 20 pounds at 18 months old, he skyrocketed to 24 pounds after being introduced to italian/spanish cooking at my parents house which was fantastic. I was so happy to see him thriving, but he is losing weight again, and eating problems have arisen.
17680,
17681,He will try all sorts of food, raw pepper, celery, tomato, beef, chicken, kielbasa, broccoli, you get the idea.
17682,The issue now is that I will sit him down to eat and he will happily chow down on 2-4 bites and then refuse everything else. He won't feed himself(and if he did he would probably weigh 0 right now) for a few months I have literally been prying his mouth open to get food into it so he would eat. 
17683,Now he might open his mouth if he's feeling cooperative but he will not chew/swallow any of what is in it.
17684,He will hold it in his mouth for HOURS until he finds a good place to leave it behind.
17685,Sometimes I can't tell he has anything hidden in his mouth until he gags on it and then throws up what we have managed to get him to eat. Its frustrating. Really frustrating.
17686,
17687,Some days I have 0 issues getting him to eat and he will eat happily ALL day going from one thing to the next, 3 full meals & snacks + drinks.
17688,
17689,I have tried giving him the things he clearly loves best, I've tried convincing him with sweet things. I've tried eliminating snacks through out the day in hopes he would be hungry enough to eat at meal times. I've tried giving him snacks through out the day as well(that is hit or miss), most of the time he just carries whatever it is around or gives it to the dog.
17690,
17691,I'm at a loss.
17692,
17693,I can't afford the toddler formula we were using when I was working, and I can't afford the pedia sure so my friend who works in child care suggested giving him Boost since it seems to help the kids he works with gain weight. I've started giving him that once a day first thing the morning. He ALWAYS finishes it, and I'm convinced this is partly how he managed to maintain for quite awhile. He is constantly in motion, its very rare to catch him sitting down, I think that coupled with a high metabolism from his Father's side has made it hard to keep him gaining the way he should be.
17694,
17695,I'm at a loss though, what can I do to get him to eat?
17696,Should I just wait it out?
17697,I feel like he is just going to waste away if I can't figure out a way to get him to eat food.
17698,
17699,Do any of you have a similar situation going on? Or any ideas I can try?
17700,

I think that in the last few months of pregnancy, with it being harder to get around (I was huge and on exercise and lifting restrictions) she started trying to get away with more and more. And now that the baby is here, she tries to get away with even more, especially when I have to feed the baby or am otherwise more occupied. I know that it is normal for kids to react this way when they get a new baby, but I am not sure the best way to deal with it.

I have two seperate questions. My little man is 9 mo old. He screams. A lot. For extended periods of time. It is fun screaming to him. He is not upset or hurt. It is not to get attention. He just screams because he can. I get that it is a learning thing but I am going to lose my sanity. How long does this last? Is there anything short of ear plugs (I have done that already) to get him to stop? Breakfast: So he eats adult food. He does not eat baby food anymore. I am struggling to figure out what to give him for a healthy breakfast. Right now it is toast and fruit. He loves toast. I tried cream of wheat but that did not go over well. He does not like oat meal. Does anyone have any breakfast suggestions? Thanks!,2

But of course, I don't want to feed my little boy these things!I'll get to the point. What are some easy to make, healthy things I could stock up on to cook him for dinner? He has 16 teeth now so the type of food isn't an issue. But yes, healthy, variety, easy to make. I'd appreciate any advice at all! Thank you. :)",2
"I hope this is an appropriate place for this question. I am just starting solids with my son. We would mostly like to be doing purees right now and possibly transitioning to BLW as I'm more comfortable with it. I've done sweet potatoes so far, and used my food processor to make it nice and smooth. Obviously, using my giant food processor is a huge hassle, so I'd like something smaller than can be used solely for making baby food.What do you all like to use? I was looking at manual food mills on amazon, but would it be more prudent to get an electric one? Or should I just look into a whole baby food making system? That seems excessive to me.",2
"I hope this is the right sub, so here goes.
My wife and I are looking to become parents in the near future, and we have encountered a point of disagreement about christening our children. We are both non-theist, with myself tending slightly more toward atheistic than she is (perhaps agnostic? we're splitting hairs here). We agree that our children will be raised in a religion-free house, and we agree that if our children decide to become theistic that we will support them.
My wife strongly insists on christening our future children. She wants the tradition, want to honour the godparents and so on. 
In contrast, I do not want to have our children christened. I think it is disrespectful to the church (not that I'm big on churches), deceptive to family and friends who may think that our child is being raised in a religious household, and unfairly involves our children who I don't believe should be having others make decisions about their spirituality (or lack thereof). 
The discussion eventually came to my wife saying that my children will be christened"". This is the point that gets me. Without making this a pro or anti religion debate  what do other people think about the value of the mother's and father's opinion on topics where no middle ground exists? We both care little for ""naming ceremonies"" Edit 1: I several words""",6
"I just found myself scarfing down a twizzler in the kitchen while my son was distracted by cartoons in the other room... all so I didn't have to share it with him. Not that I mind sharing with him (and teaching him that sharing is good) but I really wanted a WHOLE twizzler not half of one.

"I just got home from son's four month check-up. He is 24'' and weighs only 9 lbs. The doctor said that he was frighteningly small and that he was on the verge of being hospitalized. He also told me several times that my baby could have brain damage or serious developmental delays if we don't get his weight up immediately. I knew that my son was very skinny, and it worried me, but he is so active and doing so well developmentally that I figured it was fine and that we would see if everything was fine when we went to his appointment. He weighed 12 lbs. at his two month check-up, and I honestly was expecting that his weight would have just stayed the same. I was shocked when they put him on the scale and I saw his weight! 
I can't believe it! He was EBF and he ate soooo frequently, and he would actively suckle and swallow for thirty to forty minutes almost every time! He is also very strong- he rolls from both his belly and his back, he's starting to pick his knees up and sort of crawl, he can stand"" and bounce with just a bit of support  and babbles non-stop. He seemed so perfect  I just can't believe this! Even the doctor finds it very strange  and he's ordered blood work to see if it's some sort of metabolic issues or something.

So I decided that I'd rather work through my stuff myself than having him try to help me through whatever he thinks is going on (which just makes me feel like I'm not heard at all). Usually that's fine and works for both of us. So while I was writing everything down that came up I felt furious and afraid. Terribly afraid of god know what and my partner suddenly was way out of my ""safe zone"". Then another thought came up: maybe I'm justifying my fears like my mum does... She seems so afraid of everything and insists that worrying about me is her right as a mum. When I was little But with that incident today I got seriously scared that I'm starting to validate my fears and that I'll become like my mum... Super afraid of everything and trying to hold everyone around me on a tight leash so my fears won't get triggered. I absolutely do not want to be like that! I had thoughts coming up that abortion and leaving my partner would be better than that. I don't want to be a clingy mum! I want to be able to lovingly let go whenever I have to and to not hold anybody back with my fears. Preferably I don't want to be that afraid about everything in the first place... I don't really know how to work through this right now. I've closed off to my partner for the moment cause he doesn't feel safe to me right now. Has anyone had stuff like this? And found a way through?""",6
I just started making my own baby food for my 6 mo. old.  We tried sweet potatoes first and she loved them!  I baked them then put them then purred them in my food processor.  I want to do pears next but I don't have a steamer.  The book I use says pears are softer then other fruits but it's still good to lightly steam them for younger babies.

She cluster feeds on a near continuous basis for the next several hours. If she isn't eating she is screaming or taking a cat nap. I'm worried that her irregular eating pattern is not good for her.

At the same time, he is very playful, he smiles and is almost laughing, he is mostly awake during the day, and he doesn't have a dry mouth (he is actually teething and has plenty of drool...) Also, my husband thinks that it might be an issue of my own nutrition. I don't eat much, a lot of the time just one meal a day, and when I do eat, it's not always the healthiest. I have a hard time finding time to eat between keeping everything clean. working, and taking care of my son. I usually will feed him about six times a day, and then we go to bed and he sleeps very well. He will sleep through the night, except for maybe waking up once or twice, and then he won't eat, he just wants his paci and to be rocked and soothed a bit. I don't force feedings, I just let him eat when he is hungry. Since I'm breastfeeding, I can't tell how much he is eating, but he usually eats for thirty to forty minutes. So, I guess what I'm looking for is some words of advice- how often does/did your three month old eat? Are some babies just skinnier than others?

"I know the're our a lot of moms out there that don't get the credit they deserve. I posted this on facebook for my mommy today after seeing an  
[NPR article](http://n.pr/1ntc9IJ) 
Since mothers day is right around the corner. I got a story related to this article. This became a wall of text.
My parents divorced early and my mom worked a lot to keep a household afloat. I visited dad every two weeks. She bar tended when I was younger. I remember playing pool, darts shuffle board and pinball (I am really good at bar games). She finished night school and got a job in medical billing. We were leaving at 5:30 am to go to the babysitters. Shes was fortunate enough to have affordable child care. Then she had to go on disability assistance and lost her job.
I remember having to go to all of these different agencies and organization. We were open finical books. They wanted to see bank info, car papers, benefit papers. If you missed your appointment you may lose your benefits. Sometimes if you would go over a certain amount you did not qualify. The social security office, welfare office, housing office. We became experts on the system. We utilized all service available to us, we had to. Getting benefits and keeping them is almost like having a full time job.
I didn't mind, we kind of turned it into a game with thrift store and garage sell shopping (which I still do). We utilized food banks and frugal cooking. I never went to bed hungry. What I am saying it is that we made it work. It is a freaking maze to work yourself out of assistance. It is real easy to get discouraged. After your bills and groceries are all said and done and you only have 100 or so dollars for the month. 
I worked a job which affected our household income, meaning no benefits. If I became a full time student my income wouldn't count towards the household. So I became a full time student at Shasta College. Someone with a 1.8 GPA out of high school. I myself had to go through hoops to get benefits. I started to get first hand experience from my moms prospective. I then started receiving full finical aid and tuition waived because of our situation. I got a degree and you know where I am at now. My sister went the same path and has a degree from Chico State. She is more educated the myself. 

She never gave up. Moms are strong, resilient and selfless for their kids. When I look back with what I know now My mom is one of the strongest people I know <3. She doesn't get the credit that she deserves. Much appreciation and love.

"I met Steven( Redditor: [merkmal](http://www.reddit.com/user/merkmal) )when I was making coffee for $7.25 an hour almost 10 years ago at a little indie coffeeshop in Louisville, Kentucky. He worked as a programmer at a local healthcare company, and would come in during the afternoons for lunch with his coworkers. He was clearly the odd-man-out in that group, as he usually had his hair in a small mohawk and gauged ears to compliment his khakis and ID tag. If he wasn't so soft-spoken and friendly, I would have sworn he ran an underground fight club.
Anyway, Steven would come into our uptown store too, during the weekends. He'd usually sit down with a brown bag and pull out a stack of new comics to read while he drank his Americano. We had a knitting store next to us, and one day he came in with needles and yarn. This guy did not give a damn about any sort of image he had to keep up (and this was inside a trendy coffeeshop, keep in mind). He just seemed like a real nice dude... that liked to hang out with sweet older ladies and knit.
One day I introduced myself, as I handed over his Americano, and we become pals. We'd go to the comic shop together, play Castle Crashers, and get Mexican food way too late. At that time, my first daughter, Layla, was just about a year old. As a guy gets a girlfriend, kids, home, etc, he becomes more secluded. Steven and I became really close, and at times, was the only person I could honestly consider a friend. He even knitted my daughter a bracelet with her favorite color flower on it. 
I invited Stephen to Layla's first birthday party, along with co-workers and family. Every year, our invite list got smaller and smaller for her parties, but Steven always remained in attendance, and one year brought along a new friend, Leslie. I still remember as the party was wrapping up, looking onto our back porch and seeing Leslie, Layla, and my mom sitting and chatting away. It was then that I realized that Steven and truly met someone special (also because they gave the coolest presents). Last year, my fianc√© and I had our second child right before Layla's 4th birthday. I knew we wouldn't have time to get anything together by then, so we decided to skip the party that year and make #5 a good one. Steven called the day before and wondered if he'd missed the invitation. It says a lot when your friends remember your kid's birthday. 
Anyway, over the past year Steven and I would chat maybe every month or so, just to check in. He always asked about how my girls were doing and talked about video games and stuff that I really didn't have any other outlet for. (Except you, Reddit.) One day I got an invitation in the mail. Steven had asked Leslie if she'd spend the rest of her life with him. (She agreed!)
On the way to the wedding I realized that Layla hadn't seen Steven a year, and that he'd never met my new little girl, Penny.  One year is a long time for a 4 year old, and I could tell that she was a little hazy about who exactly this guy was. However, we arrived at their ceremony and everything clicked (or she just thought his pixelized tux-shirt was awesome). We all had a really great time that day, and promised to try and hang out again soon.
We haven't hung out yet, because as it turns out, in their free time, Steven and Leslie have been trying to figure out how to start their family. Both being very intelligent, compassionate, forward-thinkers, Steven and Leslie have decided that adoption is the way for them to go, but they need help. I will let them tell their own story, as they've begun a blog telling all about who they are and what they need from us. Apparently, it will cost $40,000 to adopt a child. I have two children and I don't even make that in a year! 
Their donation site has just opened, but they only have barely $25 right now. Reddit, I don't know what the best subreddit this is suited for or if I need to add cats or memes to this to get it noticed, but if you'd just simply upvote this post it would help get some awareness going. I'm hoping that people will take notice, and that our community can help these two get a good start to the rest of their lives. We need better parents in this world; can we help give these two the opportunity?Read more about Steven and Leslie's story here: http://adoptionisexpensive.wordpress.comDonate here: https://www.wepay.com/donations/adoption-is-expensive-help-leslie-and-steven-adopt",6
"I might hate them, but my 14 month old son likes peas, as long as they are pureed. He likes the Gerber ones. When I make some, canned or frozen, he hates them. He does the same with green beans, but likes corn and broccoli. Why?!? Any ideas that will help me feed this little booger some green veggies?",2
"I might not be at wit's end yet, but I can see it from here. My 12-year-old son is starting to concern me. He has always been a willful child. Stubborn, but not outright defiant. I used to joke that he was the tester of limits and surveyor of boundaries. I don't anymore.
All things being equal, I might be over reacting, imagining how bad things can get rather than how bad things are. This year at school he seems to be very nonchalant about turning in assignments in particular and homework/schoolwork in general. He isn't turning in things he's done and is refusing to write down assignments. One of the issues has been disorganization, this past Friday, I noticed the state of his backpack and told him to take out all of the loose papers, smooth them out and create two stacks for each class, one for things that he still needs, and one for things he doesn't. He refused. He wanted to just throw out what he didn't need and not give me a chance to go through it with him. I insisted and he just started throwing things in the trash. In the past, I had a tendency to bellow. For the past couple of years I have really, really been trying to keep a lid on that. On this occasion I kept my voice  calm and reasoned. He proceeded to have a meltdown that really frightened me. I stood my ground and after about 90 minutes, and after I unplugged his computer and put it in my closet, he conceded and did as I asked. I recorded part of the meltdown on my phone to show my wife. I had never seen him react that way.
My wife was out for the evening at a volunteer function and wouldn't return until late. I fed him dinner and had him go to his room and stay there until bed time.
I was starting to think I was part of the problem and the following morning, when my wife gave him a stern talking to, I opted to stay out of it. He promised to do better and we went about our day. I told him that he was prohibited from computers and his ipod. He was fine, all day. We went about a fairly normal Saturday that included a family bike ride (he has an older brother, 14, and younger sister, 10).
Today, he went with my wife to her work. She works as an admin for a CPA firm and can get a lot done on Sundays when no one is there. The plan was for him to complete his homework while she got her work done. His language arts teacher requires assignments be submitted through turnitin.com. My wife gave him access to her workstation to do that and when she returned from the copy room she saw that he was on youtube watching a batman video. He denied that he was, although the window was still open on the screen, and in the argument that followed stormed out of her office. The restroom is outside in the lobby and she assumed that he went there to cool off. When he didn't return, she went looking for him. She searched her building and the grounds then got in her car to search for him in the surrounding neighborhood in downtown Phoenix. He returned after about an hour. I would have gone myself, but I'm also at work and we only have one working car between us at the moment.
My wife and I don't know what to do. Tomorrow we are going to try to find a family counselor to get some help. We feel that this is beyond us. 
As a parent, I've never been more in despair. ",6

She seems fine with the breast still. I don't know how to get her to take the bottle again >:|.,6
"I myself am very sensitive to dairy but generally just eat less of it/don't use it in my own cooking. My son is fine with eating dairy.

"I need help ladies. †My daughter is 13 months old and has been in a home daycare since she was 3 months old. †I'm not super happy with her current situation so we're looking to move her when she can be put in the Toddler programs (18 months in NY) in April. We've looked at 2 centers so far and I need your opinions! †The first is a large center (3 toddler classrooms with 10 kids each) and has a preschool program that she would move up to after she turned 3. †It's been around for 25 years and the staff retention is great. †All three main teachers in the classrooms have been there for 10 years or more. †I've heard nothing but great things about the program and it's highly recommended. †Cons, the food isn't great and they won't accommodate my daughter's dairy allergy, if she can't eat what's on the menu than we just have to send something in and they'll only offer soy milk as an alternative to cow's milk, which I've been trying to stay away from. The center is in pretty bad shape, it doesn't look like they've updated anything in the 25 years it's been open, tiles are missing from the floor, things were taped down with duct tape, all of the rooms smelled slightly of urine, I just got an overall impression of dinginess. †It's the most expensive. 2nd option. †Is a new center that only opened in September. †It's eco"" centric so they have no problems with the cloth diapers that we use. †They cook all food on site and it's locally sourced and will happily accommodate the dairy allergy and offer whatever milk we want. †Since it's so new the facility is gorgeous and it's small †so we can't really know what the staff retention rate is going to be and there's no reputation to back it up.

"I need to interview a new(ish) parent for a project in my parenting class. Problem is, I don't know anybody that has had a baby within the past two years. That's where you guys come in. Please be specific when answering these questions. I need to write at least a full page out of these answers.
1. What is your child's name? (first name only is acceptable)
2. When did you deliver your youngest child? 
3. How old were you when you delivered your first child? 
4. What hospital were you delivered at? (you can answer an intensive care like or general hospital if you like, I'm just gonna throw in a local hospital to make this believable) 
5. Did you have a c-section or vaginal delivery? 
6. Did you have insurance or a medical card? (for a bonus, how much did insurance cover if you had it?) 
7. Did the hospital ask for payment while you were still in the hospital recovering from childbirth? 
8. If you had to estimate, how much money came out of your pocket during the first year of your child's life? (including co-pays, medicine, clothes, items for baby, etc.) 
9. What was the biggest financial shock of having a baby? 
10. Do you think you were financially stable when you had your first child? 
Other: Husband, were you and your husband still together, other things you want to add that you deem important.

"I often see posts asking for tips on how to get your baby to sleep through the night.  Sleeping through the night is seen as a big accomplishment or an indicative of good parenting.  You need to know: [sleeping through the night is a myth](http://www.parentingscience.com/baby-sleep-patterns.html).  I will quote some parts of the article, which uses various studies as sources:
> Compared to adults, babies spend much less time in deep sleep. And babies‚Äô sleep cycles are much shorter.  As a result, babies are much more easily awakened.
> A variety of anthropological, historical, and clinical evidence suggests that adults are not designed to sleep through the night. Let alone babies.
> With their short sleep cycles, babies experience more opportunities for arousal. And they have smaller stomachs, which means they need to eat more frequently than adults do.
Also, major milestones can affect sleep.  Separation anxiety, teething and learning how to crawl/walk may produce periods in which your baby seems more uneasy at night.  This is completely normal.
**TL;DR**: it's perfectly normal for your baby to not sleep through the night.",6

I've been a nanny before. I've been a nanny for children this young before. But NEVER have I had to deal with a baby like this. The parents reassured me that this happened to the dad when the mom went back to work after maternity leave, but that it stopped after a week. I've been working for them for 4 weeks and it hasn't even slowed down.
From the time I'm here to the time I leave, the baby cries. Even if her parents are here, if I'm holding her and they're not she screams and screams. And then she screams when they leave. And she screams all day right up until she's back in their arms. It's driving me crazy.
At first I thought it was colic so I looked up advice from other people online and how to deal with it. But I realized pretty soon that it wasn't colic, it was separation anxiety. Separation anxiety is something I thought a baby this age was a bit young for, but I honestly can't think of it being anything else.
It's gotten to the point where I try to make her sleep as much as possible because I can't deal with the constant crying. And when I say nothing makes her stop, NOTHING MAKES HER STOP. In fact, me holding her makes her cry even harder.

"I started writing everything out, but it was too long and simply overwhelming. I'm going to try and keep this as brief as possible. If you guys want more details, I can try and provide them. It's just so much.
Our six year old (seven in March) is showing pretty serious signs of attachment issues. Her entire childhood has been the worst years of my life, although she's not causing that and it doesn't have anything to do with her. I've developed extremely severe depression, anxiety, and self esteem issues, and I've felt completely disconnected from her for a long time. Which isn't to say I don't love her, because I do, very much.
Her dad is in the military and is gone often. He also has a few mental disorders that definitely impact our day to day lives, mainly because he struggles with empathy to a pretty extreme degree. He used to have a great relationship with her when she was little, but that's deteriorated. He spends almost no time with her or her brother, does very little around the house, and typically did not handle conflicts with her well. He raised his voice pretty loudly, and he had this way of looking at you and making you feel like dirt under his shoe. His tone of voice and expressions just made you feel like you're a total idiot. Since his diagnosis and following therapy, these things are not perfect, but have improved greatly.
Before I let you think he's the bad guy, I contribute to this, too. I also don't spend the time with them I think I should be, and I spend large portions of my day totally checked out with a tv show on my laptop, or games, or podcasts etc. Anything to keep my brain idle and occupied, because this is the only way I've really found to manage my anxiety.
Around October of this year her teacher started pulling me aside with concerns about her behavior in the classroom. She was lying, stealing, hiding things and being sneaky, acting out and being disruptive often. We'd recently moved cross country and I'd noticed all of that starting to happen at home, as well. We tried to come up with strategies to help her improve, and also made an appointment with an emotional behavioral specialist through the school. We laid all this out for her and tried to be as honest and open as possible with the reality of the situation. She said that our daughter (and us) definitely seems to have some attachment issues. She's pulling all this stuff because it gets her attention, and she theorized that our daughter has a belief in her mind that she's going to be rejected, so she acts out to prove to herself that being rejected is exactly what's happening.

Her suggestion was to ignore as much of her behavior as we possibly could, so that she's no longer getting the attention she's looking for, and no longer reaffirming this rejection belief. We're supposed to give her logical consequences i.e. if she writes on the walls she has to clean it up, but beyond that not to punish or talk about disappointment or anything along those lines. The specialist is going to be working with her at the school, as well.
That was a week ago today. Since implementing the new plan, her behaviors have shot through the roof. It literally, no exaggeration, has been NONSTOP. Every time I turn around I'm discovering new bullshit she's pulled. She's started destroying my makeup, she's started stealing food from the pantry. She steals pens and writes all over her arms, she used up the last of my very expensive, very hard to find because it isn't made anymore perfume. She paints the walls with toothpaste. And she hasn't just been stealing my makeup and destroying it, she's been painting herself and her dolls with it, too. 

She's also been going out of her way to provoke me with her behavior, as well. And that sounds like such a ridiculous thing to say about a child, but it's blatant. She will do something on purpose she's very aware she isn't allowed to do, she will call my attention to her doing it, and then when asked to stop, she not only continues to do it but she giggles in my face at the same time. After a long day two days ago of turning around to find her doing one thing after the other the entire day, she did this during bath time and I literally visualized hurting her for a moment. I had to leave the room and ask my husband to step in because I was so angry and terrified.
The specialist said this this could ramp up for a while because she's testing us to see if we'll continue to use this new response no matter what she does, but I don't know how to handle this. It's been a week and I feel like I'm on the edge of throwing up constantly. I'm just getting hit with thing after thing after thing all day long and there's no opportunity for me to try and turn things around and just enjoy her. That's all I want. I don't want to feel disconnected from her, I don't want to feel shut off, I want to enjoy this part of her life and show her how much I love her, and I just don't get to. 
I know a lot of you are going to read this and smack your foreheads because there are some obvious things here: she has attachment issues because her dad has a hard time controlling his temper around her. Neither of us spend the time we think we should with her. I'm disconnected and overwhelmed all the time. We just moved. We don't know anyone here yet and have no friends. And believe me, we get all that. I wish it was as simple as just making a simple change, but it isn't. Both of us are struggling with mental health issues that make it difficult to alter our behavior easily. I have already had one failed appointment with a therapist and I have a new one scheduled for later this month. My husband has to fight through the military bureaucracy in order to get seen by someone, and he's trying. 
Obviously, some damage has already been done. I don't know how to handle this now without totally going over the edge. I don't know how to help her, and I don't know how to stay sane at the same time. Do any of you also have kids with attachment issues? How in the fuck do you handle this? How do you not take it personally? How do you respond when they do vindictive shit? How do you find ways to enjoy them anyway?
love her. I know I've said that a few times but I almost feel like I have to defend it. I love her with my whole heart but I feel like a complete and total failure.

"I steamed and froze a bunch of different veggies for my 10 month old with the intention of defrosting them (microwave or in the fridge) for quick snacks.

"I suffered from ppd after I had my daughter in March 2011, but never told my doctor because everybody I told said I was just stressed from being a new mom, and I couldn't get insurance to pay for anything anyways. 
I'm pregnant again (due in September), and today I told my doctor I was scared that it would be worse after this baby is born. He said to remind him after I deliver her, and he'll put me on zoloft or something else. 
I have a history of ptsd, and went to therapy for 2 years in high school, but I have never been on mood altering drugs. My questions are: Would you suggest it? What's it like? Can you breast feed still? Any problems with it at all? How long do you usually take it to get better?
A side note: this current pregnancy was an accident. I wanted to wait 5 years at least, but condoms aren't very effective apparently. I haven't had the ppd as bad since I've been pregnant, but there are bad days and good days.)",6
"I swore I would never introduce my daughter to the pacifier. I've read all the negative opinions on them and didn't want her to become dependent on them, muck up her mouth, ect. I was happy when she rejected it from my mother in law (who insisted that she needed one) as a newborn, so I gave away the ten packages we got at the baby shower. That was about a month ago. So now we're at three months, and baby's new thing is to stick both hands all the way into her mouth and drool everywhere. This coupled with her bouts of crankiness means a teething baby, probably. I've given her Hyland's teething tablets as well as different teething toys, but something about her constant sucking of her hands tonight prompted me to take out the one pacifier we have from her sock drawer. She took it, but it broke my heart a little bit. I feel like I've failed in a way. But it lulled her to sleep very well and kept her from crying when she started to stir when I set her down. When she woke back up, all I needed to do was tuck in her swaddle a little and replace the pacifier. No picking up and rocking three times and cautiously setting her back into the crib before sneaking away to finally get something to eat tonight. She was moving around some but †when I went back in to check on her (as I do every 20 minutes), baby is fast asleep with pacifier still in. Ugh! But I hate it. Shouldn't I be able to get her to sleep successfully without the paci?",6
"I take care of a 4 yr old little girl and she is a great friend to my 1 yr old daughter. I have been worried that she is so thin and malnourished. They eat a lot of boxed food, rarely have fresh produce in the house, and the kids drink 1-2% milk. I weighed her today and she weighed 28.6lbs on my scale. I weighed my daughter to compare and she is 22.4lbs (she is super little, but chunky). We come to my house and I give her wholesome food and whole milk to drink.
What I am wondering is what to do with her? Her parents don't seem to really care about what the kids eat. I asked them to get more fruits and veggies for snacks and they wont. Any tips to try and help her gain some weight? I am really concerned. ",2
"I talked to one of my closest friends who is also a dad and he walked me through what he does for his son. It was an issue of changing his crib from a place of abandonment (in his mind) to a place of restful sleep. So I read to him while he was in his crib. I read 5 books and he eventually calmed down. Then he sat down while I laid on the floor and told him calming things. Eventually I turned the light off and he cried and after I re-assured him that I was still there. After another 5 minutes the yawning and eye scratching started which was followed by laying down and sitting up repeatedly. I sang ""You are my sunshine"" while slowly scooting backward until I was out of the room. Then I just closed the door... I just...I can't believe he's asleep and not because his mother put him to sleep. I love being a dad...",6

"I think my daughter, just over 2yrs old needs to move into a toddler bed. I get her up every morning and she pulls her dead weight routine on me. It strains my back to lift her, but I just don't have the time to let her dawdle in bed until she's ready. This morning was the worst, I actually pulled something in my neck/back, I've been very sore since then, barely able to move all morning. 
I want to move her into a bed to eliminate this issue. My boyfriend said he doesn't think she's ready, saying she doesn't consistently fall asleep when we put her down. This is true, we can sometimes hear her talking and playing in her crib. I think that if we go over her room once more and super childproof every possible thing, I would be fine with her getting up and having to be put back down and possibly spending a few nights sleeping on her floor.
I'm just wondering if this will work? If she's not consistently going to sleep at night and she doesn't know to stay in her bed, will this be more difficult for me to teach her the concept? ",6
"I thought I was ready for this but I was so blindsided. 
I thought 'we won't have sleep problems if she sleeps in the bed with me, babies like to be close to you.' I thought 'she won't need to cry if we meet all her needs'. Etc., etc. I thought we could handle this. I thought we could do it well and love her and be there for her in a way we never experienced with our own parents. I never knew how hard it was, how much it eats you up, and how it's the best thing in the world as well as the worst.
I've been breastfeeding for 3 months, since she was born. That's getting up multiple times a night to feed her and rock her back to sleep. I'm there for her every moment of every day, playing, singing, rocking, bouncing, feeding, laughing, crying, changing, you name it. In these first months she's cried for weeks when we didn't know why, eventually to figure it out. Sometimes not. For the first month or two it's a thankless job, there is no emotional response on their part. Then they start to smile and laugh, and that makes 70-80% of the shitstorm better. She cries in the car seat and she cries in the stroller and she cries in the carrier. She won't sleep if you put her down so she's perpetually in my arms. It's beautiful and wonderful and so so hard. I eat with her sleeping in my arms, half my food ending up on her clothes. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes frustrating. She wakes up at night needing to be fed and I used to be able to put her down and she'd fall right asleep but now she needs to be rocked back to sleep for an hour. Sometimes you go a week and things seem awesome, she's calm and happy and sleeps well. Then you hit a growth spurt and all hell breaks loose. There are growth spurts and teething and sleep regressions and developmental things, some you don't know anything about and other instances that have no name. It's like groping your way through a dark hallway for months with no end in sight. Sometimes I feel like my life is over, I never have time for yoga again, never time for a hot bath. I won't be able to go out or even go for a stroller walk, and any sense of me has pretty much evaporated once she arrived. Everything is on her schedule and according to her needs, like a beautiful beloved tiny dictator. I spend hours rocking her, trying to get her to sleep, coffee gets cold (if I even get to it). Once she falls asleep, bam, she's up in half an hour, tired, but she wants to play. Go figure. Husband has to work nights because he wants to be there for us in the day. We don't go to sleep together anymore because he helps put us to bed and goes to his office to make up his missed hours. We give each other an hour break daily and I get anxiety about trying to fit my needs within that time. Shower? Nap? Shit just spent 10 minutes trying to decide what to do, 50 minutes left. Need to make dinner, ah a 'break' from the boob monster but wait, she wants to suck so I drop everything and hubby has to take over. I have to rock her for an hour again. She falls asleep, and wakes up once food is ready. We eat for 10-15 minutes while she's on the playmat (if she'll have it) and then it's back to rocking her to sleep again. You lay down to sleep yourself and she's up in two hours. Rinse, repeat. The dogs don't get much attention anymore which makes us feel like terrible people. I'm terrified I'll not sleep for the next 3 years and then have another kid so add on to that. Feels like my basic needs are of least priority now. And I'm lucky, I have a wonderful baby who isn't any sort of especially difficult and a husband who is super involved and supportive.
But it's also probably the biggest and best investment I'll ever work my ass off for. She will have had parents who were truly there for her, nurtured her. Hearing her first cry was incredible even though my birth sucked majorly. Seeing her look at me first thing in the morning and smile, priceless. Hearing her giggle, seeing her gaze at you lovingly, watching her be content with her life, her need for you as her comfort. I've never loved like that. She's my insides, my whole heart. 
It's so, so incredibly hard and such a big jump, at least for me. It's a lot of doing what's best for her, and not much of doing things that you need to or may want to do. It's her 24/7 if you're home with them. I thought I knew so much, I never realized the astounding enormity of their newfound presence in your life. You can't go back, but you also don't want to. I'd love to just bunch up under my covers and hibernate for the next week. But even as I write this, little lady is on the boob, sleeping. It's overwhelming and depressing, it's beautiful and incredible. It's the best and worst thing you'll ever do. 
End rant. Thanks for hearing me out.",6
"I thought I would come over here first because moms are typically the people to put their children to bed over dads. That's not to say that dads can't. My son's mother puts him to bed every night, and I participate in the bedtime routine which includes teeth brushing, changing, and reading. Here's the situation. Mom has been EXHAUSTED since our son was born. He's a great kid, but he is a terrible sleeper. He wakes up most nights anywhere from 1-5 times, and he is up anywhere from 20 minutes to 1-2 hours. Mom hasn't had a full night's sleep in almost 2 years. So, I told her on Friday that she is going to book a hotel room for herself. I told her to go out and get dinner somewhere, and then take a bottle of wine to her hotel room. Then she's going to sleep uninterrupted for an entire night. (Tonight is the night) She's gone, and I think I've bitten off more than I can chew. It's after 8 and instead of reading tonight, my son opted to charge head first into a chair in his bedroom while laughing like he's at a Brian Regan performance. I brought him out to the front room to let him play himself out. (No screens, electronics, etc...) I am going to try again here in a little bit.

I try so hard to baby proof. I try to think of everything. I'm not new at this. I have four kids and I have been a mom for over 15 years. I just feel like crying right now. It doesn't help that I'm pregnant and my hormones are a mess. If there is a penny somewhere in the house my toddler will find it. One second he is under my kitchen chairs taking the nuts and bolts off of the legs (choking hazard) and the next second he is in a corner playing with a spider. As I am writing this he has found his brother's mardi gras beads from a birthday party yesterday and he is putting them around his neck. He is constantly doing really dangerous things. I feel guilty. I watch him all day. People say I'm very protective and a good mom. Now he has an outlet cover and is trying to find an outlet to stick it in. I don't even know where he got it. I don't think that anyone realizes how many close calls I have had with him. I have pulled screws out of his mouth. I have caught him taking outlet covers out. He dissects the carpet  edges and plays with the carpet tack strips underneath. I have caught him attempting to plug things into various computer ports. I can't keep everything away from him. He has a metal play yard but he can climb out. I have multiple baby gates to create corridors in my house and he is learning to open them. I follow him around. I can't look away for a second. I can't sit down. I can't use the bathroom without him. He never stops climbing. He never stops falling. All day every single day. I am so exhausted. Why does he have so many instincts to kill himself? Why can't he enjoy toys as much as sharp pointy or tiny objects? He runs FAST in public. He will find stickers on shopping carts and try to eat them while we are shopping. He grabs cans off of shelves and knocks them down if I get close enough to reach myself something from a shelf. As I wrote this previous sentence I looked down. He just had something small in his hand. It's a tiny screw! NO! It's from what is supposed to be a baby safe helicopter toy. He has manged to get the screw out! I don't even know how! I can't believe I was just writing about this and he did exactly what I was writing about! Like I said I can't look away for a second. There is no point in writing. I'm just venting. I love my little boy and I can't lose him. I'm trying so hard to keep him safe but I am no match for him. I wish we had a designated room with no furniture or outlets and every toy in plain sight in a circle around me. I would shut us into the room and then he would be safe as long as we were in there.  ,6
"I used to struggle getting my four year old to have a bath. She hated the idea, would run around the house, fight against getting changed, and moan the whole time in the bath. Note that apart from bathtimes, she is pretty much a well behaved normal four year old.
I read it somewhere, maybe here, to put a couple drops of food colouring in bathwater. What can I say - its a miracle. When I go to run a bath, I ask her what colour she wants the magic water. With a red, yellow and blue food colouring I can make pretty much any colour she wants and she absolutely loves it.
Want pink? A drop or two of red.
Want purple? A few drops of red, a few of blue. etc, etc.
So easy, so cheap and she asks every day now if tonight is bath night (usually every second night). It's made the whole experience into a great time for everyone.

"I want to start off saying that my son WANTS to ride his bike about 2 miles on his own free will. With that said... 
So I am currently an at home mom. I have gained about ten pounds since my last day of work (Most likely more).  My son got a bike about three weeks ago, the second day he went two miles and loved it and was furious when I admitted I was lost and we needed to go home. I love to follow behind him on my roller blades. Yesterday I got the idea to make it a daily thing to go at least a mile and try and loose some weight. 
As I am following behind my little one and sweating up a storm I started wondering how good this is for him. If we are pushing ourselves so hard that I am loosing weight is it ok for him? He loves the bike rides and the time we spend together doing so. I would never push him harder than he could handle, except for telling him that he needs to get himself home and I won't carry him, it has never come up yet. 
On top of this the easter bunny got him a life jacket/ swim suit. So I want to incorporate that into our biking activities. The exercise he would get at the pool is a lot more than me, I just want to do it because he likes it and it cools me off. So that raised a small concern also. 
I know some of this community is so sedentary that I have seen concerns over doing things for more than an hour. If this is you, I don't want your opinion. If you have a super active child, please tell me what you think. As I am typing this up I feel a little silly and am rationalizing different metabolisms and things of that nature. I would love some outside opinions though. thanks!
TL;DR My son wants to ride his bike so much I am loosing weight doing it, is there any way this could be bad for him if I start asking him to do it every day with me to reach my weight loss goals?
edit, forgot to say his age. He is four. He is amazing, I can't believe the things he can do physically, he is more physically advanced than most seven year olds I see on the play ground. ",6

"I was diagnosed with PSVT (Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supraventricular_tachycardia ) about three weeks ago at 29 weeks and am currently 31weeks. †This is a rapid heart rhythm originating at or above the atrioventricular node.

Just how often do we feed her the cereal? Does it need to be introduced slowly?",2
"I will leave out all the backstory and details-- but finally after 37 years of my life- I FINALLY have my OWN master bedroom/bathroom/closet and the kids have their own spaces. †My bedroom is my private safe quiet place where I can retreat and relax and unwind each day all alone. †Lately though when I am not home, 3 of my 4 kids have been getting into my room and using it as just another room in the house to play in. †They are getting into my makeup, eating and spilling food all over my bed, wiping lipstick from their mouths all over my brand new comforter :( , watching tv etc. The easy answer is to buy a new lock and lock my door everytime I am not in it. †However that is a PITA for me to deal with- I mean really, all I need is one more key to keep track of! †Does anyone have any good suggestions for how I can retrain/teach my children that in our new house my bedroom is MY private space and they shouldn't be going in it? †(The bedroom is right off the living room and in everyplace I have ever lived before I've had to share a room with at least one of them... so this is something 'new' for them too) Edit to add their ages... 9,8 and 4.",6
"I work at a daycare three days a week and at my job I am with kids 2-5. †Anyways, there are these two cute 2 year old sisters are pretty attached to me. Whenever I see them (I float, so I am in different rooms throughout the day) they lift their hands for me to carry them. And when I don't, they cry and pretty much throw themselves face down on the sand. I was carrying one of the babies, and a teacher walked up to me and said pretty rudely Please dont carry them"" and that was it. I was also told by a different teacher before too. How do you feel about this? I don't see anything wrong with carrying a baby occasionally †and I feel it'd look bad if their parent were to walk in and see their child thrown on the ground crying because a teacher wouldn't want to carry them. I don't have a problem with it For example †today during lunch one kid didnt want to eat his food. So I said sweetly †""Excuse me"" and got in front of me and grabbed him hard by his wrist and yelled at him to eat. She then put him in a corner and left him there crying. I'm a very warm and friendly person...so I enjoy carrying babies †and really cannot bring myself to raise my voice at them. I guess I just want other opinions on this? When the teacher came up to me about carrying the baby I felt a bit offended  and I also don't think it should be okay to yell and just grab kids.""",6
"I work for an awesome company that offers HIGHLY discounted rates for employees at an adjacent, well known and reputable daycare facility. My daughter is 9 months old and has been attending that particular daycare since she was 3 months old and I've never had an issue. The facility is clean super clean and safe, the teachers are great, etc. That is, until today. I go after work to pick my daughter up. I still don't know all of the teachers there, as E's only there for 3 days/week and they rotate throughout the different age groups, so I'll usually peek in the small window to see if the teacher is someone I know so I can leave my purse (with my ID in it) in my car. When I did that today, not only was it someone that I didn't know, this girl was texting on her phone while the babies in the room were crying (there were 3 including my daughter). I try to ignore it and head on in. I have my ID ready and this girl opens the door and goes can I help you?"" and rolls her eyes. I say yes. †I work with people from all different backgrounds). then I was like 'yeah just keep putting in for it †you'll get it!' and she goes 'i hope so because I hate my job here.' Now this is the part that REALLY pissed me off. The caretakers have a daily report sheet for each child that lists what they ate/drank when they went to the bathroom †complete with times and the person who supervised the activity. This girl marked that my child ate all of her purees (I brought three). I checked her backpack and ALL OF HER PUREES WERE STILL IN HER LUNCHBOX but this girl wrote that she ate them! So I ask her why she did this because it's clearly fraud and she goes 'well im still new what do you want me to do?' Just like that †with an attitude. So by that point I've had it and I say ""i'll be having a discussion with your supervisor later."" and she goes 'ugh fine whatever'. I'm SO MAD mommit. I can't believe someone would neglect my kid †disrespect me and my family. What should I do? Do I call the supervisor? Do I talk to her co-workers? I'm scared of retaliation from this woman. I don't want her to hurt my daughter. TL;DR teacher at my kid's daycare lied about how much she ate and had a horrible attitude. also she was texting.""",6
"I would just like some outside opinion on whether I should go after my son's father for child support. To give some background about him:
First off, he is abusive. I don't THINK he would ever hurt my son, but he has hurt me plenty of times, both physically and mentally. I never reported him because he always told me that if I did, the state would take my son away from both of us (which I'm still not sure if that's true or not..). He stopped working when the baby was 4 months old and I finally kicked him out (due to the abuse and constant fighting) when he was 13 months old. 
Fast forward, now my son is 25 months old, and his father has given me $300 and has seen him 7 times. Yes, that is over the entire 12 months he's been gone.
He is the textbook definition of a loser, a deadbeat, a bully, anything else you can imagine. He is NOT a good influence on my son..in fact another big factor in me getting the balls to kick him out was that my son was starting to hit me because he saw his father doing it.
Anyways..I have never gone after child support for two reasons. One, he doesn't have a job. And when he does here and there, they're under the table. So I figured the state wouldn't be able to get me anything from him anyways. Two, and maybe more importantly, I don't want him being able to take him every weekend (or whatever the deal would be). YES it's important for my son to know who his father is and I have no problem with him visiting, but he never WANTS to (like I said, 7 times in 12 months). I feel like my son would be in a bad situation.
For example, on Easter, he took him to what I THOUGHT was his sister's house. We agreed on 4 hours. He brought him back after 2, because he couldn't deal with him anymore."" The meal I had packed for him was untouched
I do NOT feel that he is comfortable or safe around him. The last two times his father has come  he has no idea who he is. He hugs my legs screaming and crying. I am struggling  and of course I could use the extra money I know nothing about how child support works and I am looking for answers from someone who does. Would I get any money anyways? Is it worth letting his father (who obviously wants very little to do with him) take him? CAN he even take him? I may have already opened a can of worms by calling the child support services (no one answered  I left a message)...but now I am second-guessing myself :\""",6
"I would like to get some thoughts from other mothers on this issue"" we're having. My LO was born a month early due to my high blood pressure. She is now 18 months. Talking up a storm †she never sits still. We are always doing different activities or at the playground. I am very proud of her and how smart she is! Right before her first birthday †then lunch †a snack †nurses to sleep for a nap †has another snack †then dinner and nurses again before bed. The only way she will sleep is by breast feeding. Admittedly there are some days where she just wont eat lunch Now to the point this new pediatrician voices concern at every visit about her weight. He asks what she eats and how often ""I need you to work with me on this"" Work with him how? How am I NOT working with him? I am very conscious about feeding my daughter and especially since he brings this up at every visit I am now constantly worried and get super stressed during those times when she just doesn't eat a certain meal. with him? I am very conscious about feeding my daughter and especially since he brings this up at every visit I am now constantly worried and get super stressed during those times when she just doesn't eat a certain meal. She doesn't LOOK super thin. She looks so perfect and a little tiny. She most certainly doesn't look like she's starving. I didn't think anything was wrong with that. Her pediatrician always brings out the growth chart and says she's in the 5th percentile. He says ""I guess this is okay but I would like to see her gain a lot of weight Today I took her in because she seems to have the starts of a cold and he said I have looked up to see if other moms have gone through this and everyone seems to think this is completely normal some kids are just small! I am just bothered and now concerned how this doctor is acting like there seems to be some problem with her being a little girl! What do the growth charts mean? Have any other mamas gone through a similar experience? Do you think I should be concerned? Honestly I think my daughter is perfectly healthy in my opinion. I guess I just really don't understand why he would be.""",3
"I wrote a post a few weeks ago about whether or not I should put my son in daycare (he is 21 months) for a few days a week or not. After reading all the responses and thinking long and hard about it, I made the decision to leap in and do it. He has been there for almost 2 weeks now and goes three days a week for just the mornings. Although the first few days were rough, he seems to have adapted to it and his teacher said he calms down pretty quickly after morning drop off. The only thing I'm concerned about is that he gets so upset whenever they transition from one activity to another. Whenever they go outside and have to come in to eat lunch, he cries. Or if he had to stop playing with a truck he found interesting to go do circle time, he cries. His teacher assured me that this was normal behavior for his age but I wanted to know from any other moms who have dealt with this type of situation, how normal is it REALLY? Should I be concerned? Is this type of behavior something that should alarm me about the program he's in? Any type of input would help.",6
"I‚Äôve posted elsewhere on reddit seeking relationship and potential divorce advice‚Ä¶ As a parent of a 6yr old boy and 3yr old girl, who has basically been a single father for the past year and a half, I need to vent and hopefully get some advice for the future as we potentially head toward divorce.
My wife has largely been out of the picture most days and nights since early last year when she started working toward leaving her stable job and tried her hand at some MLMs and now has gotten into politics, with no real stability or benefits. Her net income has gone up, and the ‚Äúpotential‚Äù income is great, but I‚Äôm sick of it all and sick of her parenting methods. When she‚Äôs out, she‚Äôs usually out late and frequently comes home after the kids are asleep, or has spent the night elsewhere, without a call, text, or having said ‚Äúgood night‚Äù to the kids (or me), which I‚Äôm always sure to note in my journal. When she‚Äôs home, she‚Äôs usually on the computer, in bed, or both, ignoring the family & doing little to nothing to help around the house. A while back, our son actually called her out on it and said she was ‚Äúlazy.‚ In addition to her career taking priority over family, she‚Äôs anti-vaccine, treats with homeopathics and essential oils, is anti-microwave, would prefer to homeschool, and as we argued about last night she doesn‚Äôt seem to want to help discipline or have routines‚Ä¶ Everything I want to do is in the best interest of the kids, but it‚Äôs easy for her to throw stuff back in my face, her having enrolled in an online school for nutrition and reading up on the health topics that interest her (confirmation bias much).
When she‚Äôs not around, the kids don‚Äôt misbehave as much and we stick to a good schedule that gets them to bed on time and up and going in the morning ‚Äì things my wife doesn‚Äôt help with. When I said that kids do well with routines, she responded by saying that that is something I say to feel better and the kids are afraid. I asked what the kids possibly have to be afraid about‚Ä¶ She didn‚Äôt have an answer, it just seemed knee-jerk. Unlike her, I don‚Äôt spank or frequently threaten to ‚Äúsmack‚Äù them, but I am stern and I‚Äôm around to do time-outs if necessary, whereas she gets to be the ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù when she‚Äôs around. 
As for arguments, she has a belief about that too ‚Äì that the kids should hear ‚Äúpassion‚Äù and that we shouldn‚Äôt have ‚Äúfake politeness,‚Äù which is her response to me asking her not to yell or use foul language in front of our kids. So, she‚Äôs brought up the topic of divorce, either directly or by referring to filing papers, too often in arguments, so I would be a fool not to plan for that. We‚Äôre currently going through a bankruptcy, as I‚Äôve mentioned in other posts, and that should be done by around the end of the year‚Ä¶ Once that‚Äôs over, I think it will be time to file, though I know I don‚Äôt really need to wait. I can only handle so much on my plate at a time‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been under constant stress the past couple years.
If/when we divorce, one of the primary things I wish to change is health care coverage and I want to get the kids vaccinated ‚Äì our son has some, then went delayed/modified schedule, then stopped, but our daughter (a home birth) hasn‚Äôt had any‚Ä¶ My wife said she wanted to go modified, but now is completely anti-vaccine. I can‚Äôt imagine the fight I‚Äôll have about this‚Ä¶ hell, she said she‚Äôd get a court order when we fought about why I didn‚Äôt buy organic carrots one time when we were tight on money!
I should wrap up my wall of text, so lastly I‚Äôm planning on taking pictures of the house and my wife‚Äôs messes ‚Äì she doesn‚Äôt do any chores and doesn‚Äôt pick up after herself, so along with the laundry, cooking, cleaning, etc. I do, it‚Äôs like I have a third child to pick up after on a daily basis (when she‚Äôs around). If I ever question a split, I can look the pictures and remind myself of how we lived and how little she did‚Ä¶ Mostly, though, I want to be able to teach my kids respect, happiness, and financial responsibility.
edit: I wasn't expecting the number of replies I'd need to reply to right away, so I was going to wait until I was at work, but my wife is out for the evening, so taking a min. to check in...
edit2 (wed): I'm home with a sick kiddo, so I don't want to neglect him and spend all day posting, but hope to get to some of the great comments - many more than I expected, so thank you!",6
"I'd like some advice and some experience on this. My ex and I have been raising our 3 1/2 year old little girl in seperate households for about 3 of those years. After a bit of difficulty in the beginning (we didn't end well) we have made it work very well for all of us- he sees her usually 2 days/nights a week and I get the rest, we are pretty good at communicating, he pays all his child support on time and is overall a great father. Consistent rules/discipline has never been too much of an issue because there isn't anything major we disagree with, but lately I have been noticing really minor things- at his house she has to eat a certain number of bites before she can get up from the table, at mine she doesn't have to eat as long as she knows she can't get up until everyone is done, at my house she can't get another toy out until she puts the current one away, at his it doesn't matter as long as they all get picked up eventually; at mine there are no food and drinks for a certain amount of time before bedtime, at his she can have bedtime snacks, etc.- and she is at the age where she is starting the but mommy/daddy lets me!"" stuff. Now I know consistency is important †and how consistent do we need to be? I've been telling her for the most part ""you can do that at daddy's house †but at mommy's house we do it this way"". Is that okay for little things like that or do we need to try to do EVERYTHING the same? We both discipline pretty much the same her bedtime is the same at both houses †she eats healthy and takes naps at both places †has the same safety rules... is that enough?

"If you throw it on the floor then you can eat it off the floor. Also, if you decide to learn how to crawl out of your crib and therefore do not take a nap mommy will go crazy and make you eat your snack off of the floor...where you threw it. ",1
"If your child goes to daycare and you have to write their name and date on their bottles, or lunch boxes. Try this, use white electrical tape and a sharpie. The tape will stick to almost anything and the sharpie will last for weeks, even when washed in the dishwasher. We put our daughters name on her cups, lunch, and snack containers then added another strip of electrical tape to put the date on it. That way you don't have to keep writing the name, the date strip is a little longer so we can mark out the old date and write a new date.
Also When we go on trips for a few days, we mark each cup, and container we have so we know we will not for get it, if we have 4 cups we mark them like this: 1of 4, 2 of 4, 3 of 4 and 4 of 4, that way we know if we are missing one(we are always missing one)

"I'll try to make a very long story, short. Thursday night I got a call from my daughters daycare that she woke up from her nap with the shivers, chills, and a fever. I went to pick her up, and scheduled an appointment with her pediatrician for 8:50pm later that night. As we're home I notice her fever just isn't going down even with both acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Her fever hit 105 and I called my husband that I'm taking her to the ER. I also had to take my 3.5 month old with me. As any parent who has been to the ER knows, this was no slow process. We were there until past midnight, to be sent home with antibiotics for a kidney infection. Our two year old slept in bed with us, wanting me to rub her belly and back, when she finally did fall asleep I was just getting kicked in the head by her, plus waking up every 2-3 hours to nurse my younger one. My SO works hard, wakes up early so I figure I should be up with the girls. 
This goes on like this for the next night (it happened Friday). Sunday morning I wake up to go to work (I generally only work Sundays). I wake up a bit late, rush out of the house with no breakfast. Not too big of a deal, I'll stop by the Starbucks next door when I have a couple free moments at work. We end up being super busy and I have no time to eat. I get home expecting us all the go out to finish some last minute shopping. First thing I do is open the fridge to put my pumped milk from work in the fridge, I notice that almost all the milk I left pumped for my husband to feed my daughter is still in the fridge. I ask him what's going on, he says she's been sleeping all day and not wanting to eat. Not normal for her. I tell him to get our older daughter ready and I'll nurse the little one. As I put her in my arms, I realize her head is hot. I take her temp, it's 103. Call the pediatrician, says it's too high for such a young baby and take her to the ER. My husband stays home with my older daughter and I take the little one to the ER. Once again, there for hours with them doing tons of testing. Everything comes out normal, she just has a viral thing, tylonal every 4 hours. I come home around 2AM exhausted. 
Of course I find my husband and my 2 year old passed out in bed. I get the little one ready for bed, nurse her and finally get some little sleep while being kicked and waking up to nurse the little one. I volunteered at works weeks ago to work Christmas Eve, so I didn't want to call my boss and cancel last minute. I wake up a couple hours later and leave for work, with no breakfast. As I'm driving I start to feel light headed and realize that I haven't eaten since Saturday afternoon when we went out for lunch and that it's been a couple days since I had more then 2 hours of sleep at a time. 
Things start to get a bit fuzzy and I tell myself I'll stop by the next gas station to get a cereal bar or something. I feel myself going and I start to tap on the breaks, I must have blacked out because the next thing I know I've slammed into the car in front of me. I see it's a family with 3 carseats in the back and I'm terrified. The mom comes out looking like she's about to yell at me, but I think she see's the look on my face and doesn't say anything. I start crying hysterically apologizing, asking if her children are okay. She says they are all fine, everyone is fine and asks if I'm okay. I try to get out of the car, and realize my door is jammed. I try the passenger door, also jammed. They call 911 to help get me out. 
Thank goodness their car wasn't hit too bad, but my car is pretty much completely totaled. My husband and I are young and don't understand insurance very well and didn't realize that when we signed up we didn't have any collision insurance and they aren't covering anything (after saving up my whole pregnancy to get this used 06' Tucson, purchased a day before I went into labor, making us the owners less then 4 months). 
I was so focused on making sure everyone else had their needs taken care of, I forgot to take care of myself. It was a serious wake up call. Sometimes we may think it's selfish to say we need the extra sleep or to stop and get a snack, but it's seriously mandatory that we parents make sure we're healthy. It could have ended a lot worse, and I'm lucky my car was the worst of it. 
**So just a reminder, take care of yourself. It is so easy to put our children and spouses first, but we need to make sure we put ourselves on the list of priorities too.** ",6
"I'll try to make this short. My twins are 9 months old and I suspect my son is having issues with the cows milk in his formula. He's EFF, while my daughter is EBF since 1 1/2 months old, prior to that she was on formula while I pumped waiting for them to breast feed. While she was on formula she was always spitting up, crying and overall not happy after eating, after she started breastfeeding things calmed down. My son within the past couple of months has started having a lot of issues with his poop causing horrible rashes. After doing some research it almost looks like it's a milk intolerance. I brought it up to the pediatrician yesterday at their 9 month appointment and said I don't want to put him on soy formula and we'll just stick it out for the next 3 months until he can drink milk. And I asked about trying goats milk, our pedi said they don't recommend it because of the low iron content, but I said we could fortify it with iron drops no biggie. Their doctor recommended almond milk as an alternative, but I know, and told her, that it has a low fat content not intended for children until 2 years old. At 2 years old I wanted to switch them both to almond milk any way, but I have a whole year of trying to find something that works until then.
* Has anyone given fortified goats milk to their 1-2 year old due to suspected cows milk intolerance? Did it help?
* If we end up doing almond milk, how do I up his fat content? Do we add fat to his food and what kind of foods do you add to help the fat content?",6

What I'm trying to say is, she has a plan and a method for parenting and it's working gangbusters! It took a little convincing, but I came aboard 100%.
Our son was an unplanned pregnancy and suffice to say, we've struggled financially for a large portion of the time. We're in a really good place right now and she's started talking about the possiblity of having another child (she'd really like a girl).
I fear that the introduction of a child at this point will set us back to the financially uncertain period of our lives and also worry that the age gap between our son and a potential baby would be bad.

I said this based on war stories from my service-industry friends. They said it was harder waiting on tables with kids because they had to do the same amount of work but for less tips because the parents bought less food. (I spared my coworkers that explanation though!)
They didn't seem mad but the conversation ended shortly after that. How deep down my throat is my foot?",6
"I'm a first time mom, 22 years old and currently breastfeed my 2month old son. I have a SERIOUS addiction to sugar. When I say serious I mean binge eating. For example I'll eat a whole chocolate cake in one sitting with icing and then guess what it's time to feed my kid and I'm just giving him pure crap....breastfeeding is really really important to me so I really don't want to stop but I'll admit it I am an addict with food, alcohol, drugs pretty much anything I can get my hands on that gives me that high"" it's just that right now it happens to be food because I breastfeed and have enough self control not to do anything else.....but I know all that sugar can't be good for my kids brain or development...I know he's not getting the nutrients he needs but I do t know how to stop...it's really hard...I'm supposed to go talk to an eating disorder specialist this week but I just can't help feel like I'm just sitting here poisoning my son...please help :(",6
"I'm a mom of a 2 year old. She is awesome and my biggest priority, my husband is the 2nd priority. Other than the odd cleaning job I'm a stay at home mom. I have a seizure disorder so I'm not allowed to drive, and the public bus system is frequently too stimulating which causes me to have seizures. Transportation is a somewhat difficult thing for me so I do have to rely on my husband for it. 

My parents are both disabled. My dad just had an angioplasty today and he came through fine. My mom is diabetic, and in a wheelchair due to having lost her legs to diabetes. She is totally reliant on other people to do everything for her. I'm usually fine with helping my parents as much as I can. Still I have to fit helping them around my husband's work schedule, and taking care of my kid. Currently my husband, daughter, and I all have colds. 

Tonight at about 11pm while my husband is at work my phone starts ringing. Every 20 minutes I'd receive a text, or a phone call. My daughter and I were in bed sound asleep. My dad, and my mom are blowing up my phone with Go help mom!She needs ____________ and _______ and ______!""    Please just insert various things such as walking the dogs I refused to take my toddler to their house until recently.

"I'm a mom of a gorgeous 14 month old girl.  We probably won't have another, my husband will be a drill instructor for the marine corps starting in the fall. 
I've been having weird anxiety lately about random things seriously injuring my kid. Or potential diseases she might get. Mostly its not in the now, but in the eerily not too distant future. Sometimes its specific, like 'what if she gets mrsa?' And sometimes its less so, like (what if somehow the global warming thing affects her directly in the future?)  I feel half like i want to hide us all in a bunker and half like i need to learn to grow our food and start learning to weave. 
These are generally not pleasant thoughts and I do not wish to have them.
Has anyone else experienced this? I think I could deal with it if I thought it was a normal part of being a mom.  Doesnt there seem like a heck of a lot more stuff these days to worry about?
Phew, actually feel a bit better just writing it all down.
After reading the post I thought I should add that I'm not thinking about hurting myself or my kid in any way. ",6

"I'm a single dad, and I'm quite protective. I came home from work yesterday and (as I usually do) went up to her room to say hi. For whatever reason I forgot to knock, and was greeted with a sight that left nothing to the imagination.
Obviously it's my fault for not knocking, and things were awkward at the dinner table.
They're both of age, and I know the boyfriend quite well (they've been together for about half a year now), so I'm not worried in that respect. But it's the first time I've had to deal with something like this. I feel like we should talk about it, but I don't know what to say. They weren't using protection (as I say, nothing was left to the imagination), but I don't know whether or not she's on birth control. She's also never been to the lady doctor. Should I be discouraging this, encouraging this, or what? I'd feel partially responsible if I did nothing and she ended up pregnant.
If she's having sex I'd much rather she did it somewhere she feels safe, with someone she feels safe with. Also, I don't have a 'moral' objection to responsible teenagers having sex if they want to - it's an important, fun part of a relationship.
So basically, should I broach the subject, and if so, how? How has anyone else dealt with this situation before?",6
"I'm a stay at home mom with 2 and 4 year old boys, my sister works full time so she is paying me 100$ this week (yes, i know, that's not nearly enough) to watch her kids (6 yr old girl, 7 yr old boy) for 10 hrs a day. She doesn't provide food for me to feed them, so even tho she's paying me, I'm spending half of it just feeding/entertaining her kids.
Finally, a couple days ago, I asked her to supply food for them. So Wednesday she brings a box of macaroni, a can of beefaroni, ramen noodles, and cookies. Her kids eat A LOT, but i was able to make that work for the day. However, she still hadnt fed them breakfast when she brought them over, so i still had to run to the store with 4 kids in tow and buy a box of cereal (I don't give my kids cereal for breakfast, I usually make something home made). Then yesterday, all she brought was one box of macaroni and a bag of marshmallows to feed them.. for the entire 10 hours i was watching them.. needless to say, I still had to buy food for them. Now, today is Friday, last day I have to watch them, and she provides a ziplock bag full of Easter candy and 4 tubes of Go Gurt. First of all, that is HARDLY enough, or anywhere near healthy, to feed 2 school-aged children all day. Also, again, they haven't had breakfast. Second of all, she KNOWS i do not give my kids candy/cookies/etc on a regular basis. So now I'm listening to my 4 year old cry because he doesn't understand why his cousins brought candy that he isn't allowed to have. It's not even 9am, I'm not giving them candy!
Sorry, i needed someone to complain to..
*EDIT - one day this week, her daughter also completely shredded her dress by ripping it a little more over and over until it was unusable. so I took a shirt out of my closet and kind of fashioned it into a dress for her.

"I'm a stay-at-home father of two children, a 7 year old daughter and a 1 1/2 year old son.  I have always tried to encourage them to drink water and usually give them water at breakfast, lunch and diner - saving milk, soda, and juice for snacks or treats *(I make sure they get enough milk, eat fresh fruit, and rarely give them soda)*.
Everyone from my wife to our parents act like I'm doing my children a horrible injustice.  I can't seem to get them to understand the benefits of drinking water.  It's the most wonderful liquid in existence and yet they act like I'm a bad guy because I give my children water.

"I'm a stay-at-home mom to an 8 month old baby. My husband works full time. Lately I have been feeling so disempowered about our finances, but I feel so embarrassed to talk about this problem to my family. 
We have been together about 5 years, were engaged for 1 year when I got pregnant. We had a small marriage ceremony when I was a couple months pregnant. We discussed our finances and things have always been whatever I have is ours"" but we never had a joint account and I never felt a strong need to have one because I have always had my own income. We discussed and decided I would stay home with the baby. The numbers worked. But my husband never added me onto his bank account. OK  no big deal I thought. I still had some money in the bank It turns out my husband has been lying to me about how much money he makes (WTF?). I came to discover this after a lengthy argument/discussion about our finances. (The reason: He seemed to run out of money really fast and my one credit card which he agreed to pay was past due. I have never been late on payments.) He says he lied because thought I would think less of him. I said we had issues about financial transparency and that I needed to be added onto his bank account. He said he would NOT ad d me. At this point I'm thinking oh god I've screwed myself I'm one of those women financially abused by her husband. He says he pays for everything (this is true There is other stuff. I gave my husband $500 in cash in the first few weeks after we had the baby to send a payment to the hospital and he never made it. I should have sent it myself but I had cash and I was so tired back then hy not trust your husband? I got a letter about it being past due and husband says ""that a mistake"" then that ""he took care of it."" Then I get another letter. Then I find out he asked his mother for $1000 ""to pay the hospital expenses for the baby."" Our portion due was only $500 and I paid it. This made me especially upset because I don't want anyone to pay for our baby's delivery expenses besides us as the parents. He asks his mother for money without discussing it with me. She is a wealthy old lady and it may not be a big deal to her but it matters to me. I told him I disagreed with him asking her for money because there should be no need - in theory he makes enough to cover our expenses with a bit left over. He says that it's not really my business if he asks his mom for something because it's his mom. Today  husband asks me I have $25 in my bank account right now. I feel so low. I used to be independent. I'm so stupid for not having set up our finances before getting married. I may have not left my job foolishly thinking my husband would take of us. I may have never decided to have a baby with this man in the first place. I'm working on becoming employed again and I also have to figure out child care which adds another layer of sadness to this whole situation because I know I will miss my baby. I'm not sure I will get over this even if I get a job though? He says I don't need to work right now and to just take care of the baby and that I can work when she's older. I don't think that will work for me. But I do kinda feel guilty that I want to work and will have to leave my baby - for money? Or is it more about financial freedom? Is that more important than being home with her? He does pay our bills. I just have zero money and zero access to his accounts. What do I do? I'm open to insight or advice. Thanks mommit. """,6

"I'm an aunt of a 6 year old kid who talks nonstop about food.right after one meal, he's asking about the next.he eats healthy but also loves snack foods.his mom is great about food with him, the problem is he bugs her and everyone else about what's next and wants to eat every 20 minutes. We are all frustrated with the never ending chatter but can't get it to stop.
I'm a young aunt and he often follows my example and listens to me, so what can I do  to help? I'm not around him much but when I am, I refuse to listen to him talk about food if it isn't meal time.  He is great about sharing so it isn't a hoarding problem, but sometimes he probably would eat way too much if he had the option (he doesn't but he always tries to ask for more and more.) 
edit: I was hoping someone would've had a similar experience to share, but thanks for the feedback. To clarify a little bit, he is very involved with mealtimes and as in every aspect of life, we encourage him to explore and be curious. He is fed very well (never denied healthy food), so most of the time I feel like maybe it's a control issue. He has wonderful manners except around food when he will be bossy, controlling, and demanding. He'll be full, but want to negotiate what he will be able to eat the rest of the day and the next. I am sorry if someone thinks using the words bugging and fed up"" are the wrong ways to talk about a child",3
"I'm asking this for my poor sister who has an adorable year old who is extremely difficult to feed.
She has been to numerous doctors that have found nothing wrong with her other than she's very underweight and because of that slightly developmentally delayed.  This is a very bright, happy child with a MASSIVE personality who is exceedingly opinionated.  
Even from infancy she was difficult to feed.  Hard to get her to take much breastmilk, refused every kind of bottle and formula given, even would find the tube in the assisted nursing device (designed to give formula to a baby WHILE breastfeeding) and use her tongue to get it out of her mouth.
Right now my sister has to try and get 6 ounces of supplement into this VERY difficult to feed child after every meal.  She's lucky if she manages to get 4 ounces into her.  It is a daily from morning to night fight.  And when I say difficult to eat I mean she gets a mouthful of the supplement and will literally hold it for 5 to 10 minutes.  Any attempt to get her to swallow, like lightly rubbing her throat, she spits it out.
Anyone else dealt with this?  What sort of things did you try/learn/etc?  We are all running out of ideas.
Thank you for any suggestion you might have.",1

"I'm going out on a limb here.  My daughter had her shots and dose of Rotateq earlier this month and four days later she had her first green poo with a dash of blood.  I thought she was just following the path of MSPI like my oldest, but now that I look back, his showed up shortly after he had his shots as well.  I'm not anti vax, I'm just trying to see if the problem we've been having is a result of the Rotateq. 
My son never cleared up when I went off  of dairy and soy.  2 months later he just suddenly got better and I could eat normal again.  It's been about 3 weeks now for baby girl, and no sign of it getting better, maybe even getting worse.  Just wondering if anyone else has noticed this type of thing after their kids got their dose.",6
"I'm going to be brave and not use a throwaway for this. My baby is 18 weeks old today. I feel like I am losing my goddamned mind. He is a wonderful baby, great sleeper, eater, totally mellow and stunningly beautiful. When I'm with him and taking care of his needs, I am generally just in the joy of being with him and that's all. The birth was very traumatic, both of us almost died in the process and we ended up in emergency C section and got him out in the nick of time. It was horrible and beautiful and even though I definitely felt traumatized by it all, I was pretty sure I had gotten over it. I realize now I was just numb. 
These last few weeks, I have felt this crushing depression creeping up on me. I am literally scared of the person I am becoming. Angry, irritable, despondent. I'm the primary breadwinner in my house and have been for years. The pressure of that is crushing. If I lose my job, we're completely fucked. Every dollar I earn is leveraged and we are deep in debt with no way out. 
I have also not experienced a night of unbroken sleep in over a year. I had severe insomnia in my first trimester that gave way to body aches and discomfort that woke me every hour, on the hour. Now that the baby is here, even if he is sleeping in, I still wake up engorged and either needing to feed him or pump. I experience pure rage at my husband several times a week, who is generally supportive and loving and tries to help. He's offered to get up in the middle of the night to feed the baby but I won't let him because the baby needs that pumped milk for the daytime when I'm at work and I'm awake no matter what. When my husband complains that he only got six hours of sleep the night before, I want to throw things at him and scream. He told me he feels that he has to tiptoe around me or I'll take his head off. 
Last night I told my husband I often felt like leaving him, that maybe things would be better if I was on my own and not so angry all the time. He was outraged and hurt beyond belief. He kept demanding an explanation and I couldn't give him one. I know what I'm feeling is irrational. I can't break it down in terms that his logical, analytical mind will understand. He can out-argue me on anything. He goes into Mr. Fix It mode and I go even more crazy. He literally told me last night that I need to eat more eggs to balance out my nutrition and I'll be fine, and that I'm making up all this drama out of thin air. Things are fine, why can't I just see that? My ability to articulate myself goes out the window when we have these kinds of discussions and I just break down and cry and rage. He pointed out last night that I am clearly imbalanced and I realized...he's totally right. I started researching PPD last night and called my doctor first thing this morning. I am extremely emotional and upset (and completely sleep deprived). I'm at work right now and having a terrible time not breaking down. I'm so scared. I almost destroyed my family and I don't know why. 
I didn't think PPD this far out was possible, that it was something you experienced a few days after birth or not at all. I don't know why I'm posting all this - I guess I just need to know that I'm not alone and that there's a light at the end of the tunnel.
TL;DR: Son is 18 weeks old, I love him but outside of my role of motherhood, I feel insane and broken. Going to doctor today. 
Update: First, thank you for all the support! It is tremendous help to know other people have experienced this and gotten through it. 
I just left the doctor - she put me on a low dose of meds and basically ordered me to sleep. I talked with my husband and he is going to start taking some of the night shifts so I can sleep more. ",6
"I'm going to try to keep this short. I'm still 40lbs over my pre-pregnancy weight (it's almost been a year) and I'm so self conscious its debilitating. It's like a bomb went off inside me. I know that pregnancy does wonderful amazing goddess things to a woman but in all honesty, it destroyed me. I look like a completely different person. People don't recognize me. My husband says supportive things but his lack of action in the bedroom hurts. He just doesn't initiate sex. Like at all....He does nice things, buys me outfits to feel sexy/jewelry. He's actually done a lot of material things to help. And they do for a short while. But I'm crying over how I look and my body pretty much everyday. I have a history of an eating disorder and i cant seem to stop the horrible things I feel about myself. In trying to help myself over the past 2 months I started taking vitamins every morning along with a protein shake. Walking at least 5x a week with the baby and dog. I had bloodwork done with my doc and everything (thyroid too) came back normal. This week I admitted to my husband that I'm depressed over how I look. He knew, understands and is trying to help. I see him trying to help. But it's just such an intimate thing- I don't think it's really fair for me to ask anything of him because in the end I know the confidence has to come from me. So my question is - how do I get my self-confidence back? How did you learn to accept yourself the way you are?†",6

"I'm happy to give advice on what carseat to buy, when to make changes, any installation or use questions you have, or answer *why* to anything you wonder about carseats.
[Proof](http://i.imgur.com/z52YR.jpg)
I've been a carseat tech since 2006, and I just recertified for the third time in July (hence the date on my new card).  I'm a mother of two, a ten year old 63 pound child in a backless booster in my car and a high back in my husband's (expiring in November) and a three year old (today!) rear facing in convertible carseats in all cars.  The next time we travel we might have to turn her forward as she may have outgrown our travel carseat rear facing by height.  It'll be her first time riding forward facing.
The big things to remember:
1. Don't rush your child out of a stage too early.  Leave them rear facing as long as possible (ideally to four), in a harness with top tether until booster maturity (at least five to six years), then in some sort of booster in the back seat until puberty (when the skeleton gains adult strength and the adult safety systems in the car can help, rather than hinder).
2. Always buy a ticket on a plane for your child and use their carseat on board.  It's not safe to check a carseat, nor is it safe to have projectiles on board.  As evidenced by the announcements to store your laptops, bags, books, etc. before take off and landing.  They have the flight attendants sit, and the soap in the lav is on a stick so it doesn't hit you in case you're in there during turbulence.  But children under two are allowed to be free, against the laws of physics.  It's also the FAA, AAP, and NTSB's recommendations that lap babies not ride and that they use carseats (citations available if requested).  
3. Your child isn't safe if your car is unsafe.  Keep your car in good condition, and keep any projectiles in the car contained.  Rule of thumb, if you wouldn't throw it at your baby's head, secure it somehow.  This goes for the family dog as well.  To make it basic, Newton's second law is weight times speed equals force.  So a 70 pound dog in a 30 mph crash is 2100 pounds of force.  A literal ton.  So secure your dog, your groceries, and any toys/water bottles/purses you have in the car.",6
"I'm having some trouble figuring this out.
My child will be 7 months old in 4 days.
He's crawling around, sitting up, standing himself up and has 2 teeth.
I'm reading online about what to feed a sitting child and I'm quite confused about how to go about doing this.
The general consensus is that they get 1/4 cup of fruits twice a day, 1/4 cup of veggies twice a day, 1/4 cup of pureed meat twice a day, and a few ounces of cereal on top of 24oz of breastmilk since most of the calories still need to be from breastmilk.
My wife and I are trying to think this through. Is this twice a day as in, you mix this all together in one giant pot and split it between 2 feedings, or is it that you have all these separate foods at meal time and give him one after the other, while breastfeeding during the day?
What we do now is give him, for example, a 1/4 container of apples and blueberries in the morning mixed with 3tbsp of oatmeal to thicken it up for him since it's easier for him to keep it in, and then we'll let him wash it down with breast milk, then give him some more breastmilk during the day when he's hungry and at night time we'll feed him sweet potatoes and turkey mixed with oatmeal followed by a breastmilk wash.
Does this sound right? He seems to be doing fine, but after reading the website I'm worried he's not getting enough to eat during the day even though he doesn't act hungry except at meal times. Even then he doesn't always finish eating what's in front of him.
**EDIT**
Thanks for the advice guys! I feel much better. I usually have never worried much about what any book"" has to say since I know that most parenting is purely instinctual But keep your own practices going. I know from the past 7 months that I've gotten a lot of great help from just a bunch of different stories and I hope this thread can do that for other people as well.""",2

The company has promised to work around it, but I won't see how much until Monday. 
I have so many people that have offered to help, but nobody has actually talked to me about what I  might need help with, and when. Is there some kind of babysitting train thing like meal trains?

"I'm having trouble with my daughter eating her bottles. She use to be such a good eater, she would eat 6 oz. within a matter of minutes now it takes us like 20 and after 2 oz. or so she cries and I have to sit her up and calm her down. I feel like i'm force feeding her just to get her to eat. She is teething and I thought that was the problem. But i'm not quite sure now. She shows no signs of an ear infection either. I'm frustrated and stumped.",6
I'm helping out a young mom who has been put on medication for mental health reasons so she can no longer breast feed. The baby is very attached to her with dad temporarily out of the picture and the doctor says she has separation anxiety. The baby refuses to drink the bottle. She won't take her naps because she is so hungry and spends a lot of time crying. Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Any advise to how she could get the baby to take to the bottle? Any advise on which formula is best? Thanks moms!,6
"I'm hoping to piggy back on the thread about kids drinking juice.  My husband and I are having a disagreement about the flavored waters - for example: [Sparkling Ice](http://www.sparklingice.com/product/blackraspberry).  Our daughter will be 2 tomorrow and we do only water and milk right now.  We've never had a problem with her refusing either.  My husband decided that we should start introducing her to these flavored water... there's no sugar and no calories, so I'm having a hard time coming back with a valid argument.  I just don't think it's necessary to do this.  It's not like she's refusing to drink anything else.  I'm very anti-juice (which I have a hard time getting people to understand), and feel that this falls under that category.  We're talking to our pediatrician on Monday about it (that's how I settled the argument for now).  I'm betting she'll say drink more milk for the fat and calories (my daughter is tall for her age, but probably 30% for weight).  
Has this come up with anyone else and how did you handle it?  This seems to be one of the few things we're not on the same page about.  TIA.
**Edit**:  thanks for the responses everyone!  When I talked to my husband about it again I told him about the Sucralose or Green Tea extract that's in it...  he didn't realize that, but after I pointed it out, it turned into a non-issue.  Turns out she was about 30% for weight (27.9% actually), and we decided to stick with whole milk for the calories.",2

My daughter is almost 1. She eats well overall and she has been eating chunks since she is 8 months old. She is in the 90 percentile for weight and height.
She is becoming a big girl and she is starting to drink less milk. We have switched from formula to whole milk.
She never loved bread and grains and I'm a bit worried she does not eat all the carbs she needs because of that.
She loves fruits and veggies, she can't get enough. Meat and yogurt is nice too, she eats cheese when she feels like it. 
But I can't make her eat bread. She sometimes eat rice (sticky little rice balls). Pasta are ok (whole grain). But I can't make her eat pasta everyday, no? 
Overall, she eats maybe 1 portion of grain every 2 days. Is that enough? ",2
"I'm not sure if I have it but I am finding I have almost uncontrollable rage towards my SO. He works during the day and myself and baby (3months) carry on happily. Then my SO gets home and the house slowly gets messy and I would like him to look after baby while I clean and cook dinner with the understanding we will swap over when I need to feed her. 
I find him useless. He won't follow simple instructions and will in turn make the meal an inedible mess. After spending a good chunk of time prepping and all he needs to do is take something off burner or watch something/stir etc. meanwhile I'm dealing with crying and her ripping off my nips. Then I finally get her down and find he hasn't tidied anything in the kitchen. I'm finding his clothes everywhere and just in general he seems pretty absent even though he is there. 
If I give him baby to look after he will just leave her to cry on his chest while he watches YouTube music vids and plays a stupid iPhone game. I can hear him saying absentmindedly  there there"" but not really doing anything to soothe her. When I suggest something like pat her or walk with her he acts like I am asking the world and also judging his parenting (which I didn't at first but after three months I am).  He does try some of the time if it suits him (giving her a bath once a week taking out rubbish Am I expecting too much? I find I prefer to be away from him and get so angry at him I would seriously like to physically smack him (not my personality at all and kind of scary to me).

"I'm not the only one, right?
My husband's best friend is deployed to Afghanistan and returns this summer. So DH tells me that his wife and him want to rent a condo near us on a lake, and have us spend the night with them. I am DREADING this and here's why.
Before either of us became moms, I was comparing myself to this woman as the perfect wife. She never wanted a regular job, so she was a stay at home wife before she became a SAHM. (Not knocking either of those things!) She is always well put together, always cooking up these amazing dishes, her house is always clean. Now with the baby (she had hers three weeks after mine), she's doing all that AND taking care of her kid, pretty much as a single parent since her husband is overseas. 
I'm terrified that I'll leave this little overnight stay feeling like a failure as a mom. My house isn't always clean (it rarely is, haha). Sometimes pizza is what i serve for dinner because I work 40 hours and I'm tired. When I get home from work the dress pants come off and the yoga pants come on. I use disposable diapers, she MAKES HER OWN cloth diapers. She is literally super mom.
I want to do this for my husband, but I've ALWAYS felt inferior to her and I don't want to spend the whole trip comparing how awesome she is to how I'm getting by by the skin of my pants. 
I'm not the only one who does this, right? I'm not the only one who tries to avoid certain moms just because of how great they are? haha.",6

"I'm overly hormonal today and have been dealing with a cranky crying constipated 6 month old today and just need to rant. I'm in a city where I know no one, yes I go to a baby group and yes I have my husbands family but I have no one of my own, I left my support group on the mainland( I live on the island). I have lived here for 3 years and have yet to find anyone I have clicked with, while moving here I lost my best friend of 10 years for reasons not related to this. All my friends from where I used to live are going through the same life changes as me, baby's and such, yet I live a good 3 hours away plus a boat ride so I'm missing all of it, not to mention none of them have seen my little one. I never planned to stay here forever I planned to come here for schooling because it was easier to get into then move home, I'm also really bad at clicking with and making real friends. So here I am not really alone yet alone raising my first baby in a city while missing out and having them( my support network/friends) missing out as well. My boyfriend is shit at helping out, he is currently not working and is home with me and the baby all day and yet he won't lift a fucking finger! We rotate dishes yet he never does his dishes on his day EVER! I have to constantly tell him at least 50 times to do the damn dishes and he still doesn't do them unless I let the fucking dishes pile up to the point that we have no more clean dishes! Its even marked on the calender. He leaves his clean and dirty clothes on the floor, he let's dishes pile up in the computer room, which will be the baby's room after we get him out of our bed, and yet he let's dishes with food on them sit in their unless I bring them out. I try not to clean up after him because he is a freaking adult and needs to do this shit himself but ever since the baby was born he has regressed to being a child! His mother picks up after all her kids, they never had chores, never had to do a thing, she did it all. I am trying to be understanding and help him grow up but I am also breastfeeding and taking care of our baby 80% of the time. Dont get me wrong he is a amazing dad, he drops whatever he is doing to help out and spends a lot of time with our baby but he is shit at everything else. Its like he doesn't think he has to work with me on anything anymore since he's a dad now, well I'm a freaking mom and am having to do everything and more! And to top it all off all day we some how talked about his ex girlfriend who he lost his virginity to, and about how much he fucked her! To make it worse after talking about their fucking sex life today he went off to masterbate. We have just been having sex again since the baby is finally falling asleep and staying a sleep without me so we have been enjoying it and for the past 3 days have been finally having sex, only issue is he can't cum, so I'm not upset about him taking it into his own hands per say I'm just hurt that after talking about her all day he didn't even try and make a move on me and just went off on his own. I already feel gross because of the extra baby weight hanging around, breastfeeding helps you lose it my ass, and now this. I'm just feeling so drained after dealing with a screaming, crying, clingy baby all day and I was looking forward to our alone time, and now I feel unwanted. I know the baby wasn't planned but sometimes I wonder if he would have stayed with me if it wasn't for our baby. We talking about his ex a lot, I don't know why at first I tried to just go along with it and make jokes and such but now I'm suck of it, its hurting me and I don't want our baby growing up hearing about her. I try to never bring up my ex's because I know how much it bothers him but it seems like it doesn't go both ways. Ugh hormones suck, I'm also getting my period so I'm going haywire here, that's another lie, little mans not holding up his end of the deal on that one, he's breastfeeding where are all these benefits I hears of for me?

Anyone else have this happen? I feel like I give her a wide variety of iron rich foods like beans, lentils, eggs, spinach, almond butter and chicken. We used to do red meat when she was getting pur√©es but haven't tried since. She doesn't get cows milk or baby cereal but will eat cream of wheat with added iron. She just went through two weeks of fussiness and picking eating where she only wanted soft foods that were mostly fruit due to teething. Would two weeks of finicky eating lead her iron to be that low? Normal levels are 22-291 and hers was 11. Yesterday to eat she had:Breakfast: 1/2 a packet cream of wheat (the instant kind which has added iron) made with coconut milk and with cinnamon, half an egg yolk and chunks of baked apples mixed inSnack: carrotsLunch: grilled cheese on wheat bread. Banana and broccoli. †Snack: Annie's cheesy bunny crackers Dinner: grilled chicken breast, spinach, carrots, and zucchiniShe nurses on demand still and has a sippy cup of water on the counter that she grabs when she wants. I don't know if this matters. Again I haven't talked to her doctor yet I'm just looking for some advice, some iron rich food ideas and recipes, and just general thoughts on the topic. I'm really terrified I made my baby anemic. Edit: I don't think anyone will be seeing this but ill edit just in case some one comes back to the thread or searches for the post. So she isn't anemic yet which is good and my doctors advice to limit breastmilk and other liquids to 16-20 oz per day, to feed a food high in iron (meat, egg yolk, spinach, etc) every day, and to give her poly vi sol with iron for 3-6 months while I'm working on the other two items. She didnt think the numbers were low enough for huge concern and as long as I work on getting more iron rich foods into her it should be fine. She said we will retest at 18 months (5 months from now).†",6
"I'm sorry for the impending rant, but I really need help coping with this insanity. A little background: Before we were married, my husband moved up north with me and my parents because we didn't want to be separated. My mother stayed behind for a few months so we could have an income until the rest of us found jobs. We toiled day and night scrapping metal and selling yard sale junk to make ends meet. Eventually, we all found jobs and my mom moved north. Immediately, the entire atmosphere in the house changed. She thought she had been the only one struggling the whole time and she treated my husband and I like moochers. Some time passed and it became pretty apparent that I was pregnant. We were scared. When I told my mother, she refused to help me get an abortion. She said if I didn't want the baby, she would keep it--absurd suggestion; why would I want her to raise another child the way she raised me? To treat another person like an invader in their own home? So I had the baby, and my little one is a year and a half old now. Nearly a year ago, I found a really great job in a city more than an hour away, and desperate to get away from my parents, I moved my husband and my son to an apartment over there. We were doing alright, but then it came time to enroll in health insurance for the new year, and things got a lot tighter for us. It was looking like we wouldn't be able to afford our cheap little apartment in our not-entirely-safe neighborhood, never mind anything better. So I get a call from my mother. She caught my dad cheating on her and threw him out without realizing that she didn't make enough money on her own to pay their mortgage. So, thinking it was the right thing to do, we happily made plans to move back in with her and help out with the rent while also saving up for our own futures. With our tax return, we broke our lease early, hired some movers, and THE VERY DAY we moved, my grandmother called to say that my dad had a heart attack"" and that my mom was taking him back. We had no choice now. Where before we could have rationed out our tax refund and maybe survived for another year until I got a raise. Next †the horrors from when we lived there before began to make a swift return. My mother would nag me about my husband ""not cleaning"" enough; true My mom went back to constantly criticizing our parenting style and she would undermine us to our son who had previously been accustomed to tantrums being ignored. Now he must have someone in his room with him at all times. And as a consequence †my husband has even less time to clean; the cycle goes on. So they bring out this fun new idea. They're going to rent out a little shit shack down the road and open an internet cafe. It's going to cost them $3000 up front Where did this come from? I ponder. Wait. Dad †that ""heart attack"" you had; what hospital did they take you to again? They didn't take you to a hospital? No So that must have been a pretty serious ""heart attack"". How did you say you wanted us to split the bills? 50/50? But I have to save for the baby's college and retirement for me and my husband. I also have a car payment and I need to save for a down payment for a house. You say I make more than you? But the financial burden you're placing on me is a little disproportionate anyway. Maybe 60/30 would make more sense. Why are you screaming at me? I just want to save for my family's future. You guys were paying 100% of the bills here before we moved in †and we only agreed to it because you split up. Okay †look Hang on. Why are there ash trays in your room?

I feel like I've tried everything with my now 5-year-old son.  Joshua"" is my first born.  I always wanted to be a better mother to my child(ren) than my own mother was to me.  I have been attentive and patientWhen Joshua was 1 he started throwing temper tantrums.  His tantrums would include slamming his head into walls emotionally draining experience of my life.  During that time Joshua would pee and poop in his pants defiantly.  His father and I knew that we couldn't punish for accidents but the behavior had to be corrected.  We started putting ""Joshua"" in time out if he purposely soiled himself.  We would be sure to explain why he was in time out and why it was not OK to continue messing his pants to show he was angry.  This continued through the age of 4.  His pediatrician and teachers at school warned me that he had to be potty trained by the age of 5 going into Kindergarten. We have used time out with varying lengths of time according to the severity of his actions.  It was merely weeks when Joshua realized he could do whatever he wanted and only spend a few minutes in time out.  While in time out he hits and kicks everything around him.  He screamsWe started taking toys away including Joshua's favorite bear he slept with every night since he was an infant.  If he did something naughty he would say with a smile if I warned him.  This eventually escalated into taking ALL of his toys away.  On a few different occasions, our 4-year-old was left with an empty bedroom, except his bed, bedding and dresser with clothes.  He was perfectly OK with it, often even smiling about it.  He would have to do something nice to earn his toys back, one-by-one.  He never earned them all back by the time they were taken away again.
Eventually, none of these punishments worked anymore.  He would scream, hit, throw, kick, during punishment and after being punished.  One day, I decided to try something I vowed to never do.  I hit my child.  I took his little hand and I smacked the back of it with my open hand.  The first time I tried this, he cried and looked betrayed.  I wanted to cry too but I stood by my decision.  He behaved quite well for several weeks after that.  Eventually, he slipped back into his poor behavior and I felt another hand slap was necessary.  Joshua if you don't stop that I'm going to have to slap your hand again.""  He responded smiling ""OK.""  I took his hand and slapped it.  His smile turned into giggling.  I slapped his hand again harder than I planned to he still stood there giggling.  Not only did I feel bad for resorting to a physical punishment but now I was getting scared.  Joshua's little red hand was held out to me as he asked for more.  I sent him to his room and pondered what to do next. I don't remember every method of punishment chronologically  but this is everything I have tried that no longer works:  Time out (varying lengths of time) trip to favorite park cancelled trip to store cancelled trip to dinner cancelled.  If we are at a restaurant and he starts harassing the table next to us  getting under the table shouting throwing food I immediately take him outside for a time out.  His better behavior usually lasts until we can finish our food then scuttle out before he becomes uncontrollable.  If we're shopping in a department store Joshua ends up in a time out in the middle of an aisle.  It's becoming less and less effective as he grabs and throws merchandise screams and cries.  I've started threatening to leave him at the store which will make him shape up for about 15 more minutes then he forgets.  If we're driving in a car I have had to pull over and take him out of the car to get him to stop screaming and/or kicking my seat.  I have had to start threatening him with having to walk home.  A threat I can't carry through on since he's only 5.  Ignoring doesn't work.  Joshua will resort to breaking things which I feel cannot be ignored.  Our cell phones tablets tvs keepsakes expensive toys as well as cheap  have all been victims to his tantrums. You might say he just wants attention.  I actually started to believe that myself  however Because his time outs were ineffective they have evolved into putting his nose on the wall.  I remembered a babysitter making me do this as a young child.  I found it boring and didn't want to have to do it again.  Joshua growling at me.  I took a video of this to show his father.  It was like watching a child possessed by a demon as Joshua hit and kicked the walls growled snarled screamed gutturally thrashed about threw toys at me cried then eventually stopped all while keeping his nose on the wall. Before the day is a total loss I typically just try to reason with him.  I will sit Joshua down Joshua doesn't go through this every day.  Sometimes he'll do it 4-5 days in a row then go a couple weeks before lashing out again.  When he is being well-behaved drawing pictures and telling stories.  He really is the best big brother.  His little brother is almost 2.  Joshua will share toys with his brother and play with him.  If his little brother is crying about something Joshua will give him Bear to calm him down.  It's really the sweetest thing that brings tears to my eyes.  Then the roller coaster reaches the top and takes a fast dive again.  When Joshua is in the middle of a low period he isn't as nice to his little brother.  Just the other day Joshua pushed my toddler off of his bed  onto the hardwood floor  because ""he was bothering me"".  We're at that point where his father and I are considering medication.  I honestly don't know if Joshua is mildly autistic bi-polar or something else I don't know about.  I have mixed feelings If one of you knows what I'm going through please tell me about your experience.  I'm not sure how much more of this I can handle.""",6
"I'm sure it's come up before but a quick search didn't turn anything up. My son is almost 3 and my wife and I are struggling with him at dinner. The kid is a champ at eating the things he likes: pancakes, waffles, breakfast sausage, grilled cheese, french fries, kielbasa, desserts. We can also get him to eat fruit and vegetable purees in these pouch things. But we really want him to eat more food and it's a struggle. We would like for him to eat what we're eating for dinner as opposed to making him a separate meal but he refuses to even try it. And when I did get him to try something (pineapple that had been cooked with ham - and he loves pineapple) he gagged until he threw up.
This makes dinner time difficult because we insist he eat. He refuses. We tell him he can't have dessert until he at least tries some food on his plate. He is fine. We tell him he has to sit at the table until he takes a bite - just one bite! - and he'll sit there for hours. So the few hours between when he gets home from daycare and when he goes to bed are just us arguing with him about dinner.
Any suggestions? Should we not even bother trying and wait for his tastes to develop on their own?",1

She seemed receptive to that and went to be without issue but woke up around midnight ""Daddy. I had a nightmare."" then leaves the room without me to go pee. It was humorous actually almost like ""just letting you know kthx."" Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can expose her to new things and that being scared sometimes is a good thing?

"I'm very lost and conflicted - my 3.5 month old has a variable schedule at night. Last night it was every two hours she woke up to eat. Sometimes I can put the pacifier in and she will go back to sleep, if she doesn't I assume she is hungry and feed her. However, I read about not overfeeding, doing everything you can to get them back to sleep before feeding them, let them cry it out.

"I'm wondering if anyone else has had a lot of trouble losing weight after having a baby. 
I had my first child last summer and since January I have been attempting to lose weight. The past month I have been very serious about it and have started exercising 30 min-2 hours a day (running, biking, yoga) and really watching what I eat, but I've gained 7 lb. In fact, since 3 weeks after birth I have gained 12 lb. I am 5'2, now 185 lb, so I have a lot of weight to lose and this is a troubling trend.
Here is my typical daily diet (I loosely follow paleo/keto): Breakfast: banana with plain Greek yogurt or scrambled eggs. Lunch: leftovers from the night before or something high-protein, low-carb (chicken salad, chicken sausages, etc) with vegetables. Snack: apples with cheese, nectarines, or grapes. Dinner: chicken, salmon or ground beef in some combination with vegetables, occasionally whole grains (quinoa, barley, bulgur). Dessert: mango or other fruit. 
This past week alone I've had several days where I exercised for more than 2 hours, yet I've gained 5 lb. I know that muscle weighs more than fat and that sometimes you plateau because of that, but it doesn't make sense that I would put on *that* much muscle"" weight in such a short amount of time while not losing at all. I'm still breastfeeding if it matters -- once a day. When I was exclusively breastfeeding I had a lot of problems losing weight (the second I started eating healthy and limiting sugars Pre-pregnancy I would be able to lose 2-3 lb a week following this sort of diet so it's not like I'm new to healthy eating  so this is all very weird for me. Low calorie/low fat diets don't really work for me -- I end up starving bloated nd put the weight back on immediately. Paleo was my normal diet pre-pregancy I'm starting to get really frustrated and worried that I will have to resign myself to a life of obesity no matter how healthy I eat and exercise. Please help!

"I'm wondering what other parent's experience with time-out around this age is.
I have 18 month old twins. Yesterday evening, one of the twins kept attacking his brother. Things like; digging his nails into his brother, biting, pushing, hitting, and kicking.
He was being downright mean and each time I stopped him, he laughed and giggled like it was a game. I kept trying to reinforce that it is NOT okay to hurt brother but.. he kept doing it.
I got fed up and put him in his crib and told him it was not okay. I put the kitchen timer on 5 minutes and left him in his room with the door shut.
He didn't scream or cry, really just jumped on his bed and giggled. When I let him out, dinner was done so we were in that quick before bed routine and he wasn't really given the opportunity to fight, so I have no idea if the time-out made an impact or not.
But, I'm wondering if this too young to start enforcing time-outs? I felt kind of guilty leaving him in there, but I don't want to be a pushover.

"In August, I will be flying on a 5 hr flight with my son, alone.  He will be a little over 4 months, or 2 months adjusted age (born 7 weeks early).
I was considering of getting the red eye flight as it is shorter, vs 6 hrs normal flight. I also was thinking about getting a seat in the last row. The seating chart has about 3-5 empty rows in the back of the plane.  
He will be in a baby carrier.  
He is generally a quiet baby and will cry only when he is hungry or wants to be held.   I am working on mastering the various methods to quiet him down quickly.  If I have to breastfeed, I will and I have no qualms about it.  
My questions to you is: is it OK to get a red eye flight or should I find one earlier? When I fly, I see so many people sleeping, and I figure a red eye flight isn't going to make a difference, and my son sleeps longer through the night vs day.
Do people really have problems with babies on planes?

"In general I need some advice from other parents. I have a 16 month old son, he's our first child so were still pretty new to everything and aren't sure what he understands and what he doesn't. 
One thing he does is whenever I'm in the kitchen he'll come up and cry until someone gives him something to eat, it doesn't matter if we have food or just tidying up. I've been telling him no and walk out and let him cry but usually after a couple of minutes his dad will walk up and get him something. He's not actually hungry he just knows that's where food comes from. 
If he's doing something naughty I'll tell him no a couple times and if he still doesn't stop doing it ( note that during this time he'll stop, look at me and either stop doing it or do it more ) I tell him he's naughty in a stern but not nasty voice. He'll cry until either my partner or I pick him up and he'll immediately stop. 
There's more but I can't think of other examples right now, his dad says I'm being too harsh and he won't understand what he's doing is wrong until he's at least 2 but I disagree. So my question is should I loosen up on him or stick to my guns and make my SO understand? I don't want him to become a brat. When did you start (for lack of a better word) disciplining your child?

"In two months time, I'll be back to work full time and I'm trying to get some details sorted so that I can plan a proper transition for my daughter (who will be 1 year old). 
16890,
Since she was born, we've spent all day together and she gets 90% of her nutrition from breast feeding. (She's not so interested in the bottle or purees so we have started baby-led weaning.) 
I have some questions for parents who have made the transition to going back to work.
Meal planning: thinking I'll breast feed her for breakfast before I leave for work. Then lunch and snack at school with water. Is this reasonable?
Naps: At the moment, naps have been tricky: she naps best in the Ergo or following a session at the boob, in a dark room with the air purifier on (white noise). Is there a way I can help her learn to nap otherwise? Or do I just let the day care professionals find their own way? 
Separation: When she's in a good mood (not teething or tired), LO is friendly and not afraid of strangers. However, I've never been away from her for 8 hours before (breast feeding being the main issue). Any tips for making the separation transition less of a shock? 
Scheduling: She'll be enrolled for daycare in the afternoons but not yet for the mornings. Either we hire a nanny for the mornings or I move her to full time daycare in the same building I'll be working at (as a school teacher). That seems convenient (extra bonding time, peace of mind) but I'll be commuting 1 hour by train each way and wouldn't mind using that time to get my work head on (rather than struggle with a stroller, possibly cranky baby, etc.).

He pouts, cries, gets frumpy""  (sort of a ""HARUMPH"" thing)",2
"Is that normal at all? I mean all he does is eat. If I put food in front of him, doesn't matter what it is, he'll eat it.

* Everything I read talks about doing controlled crying at night, does it also work during the day?
* How long did it take you for your baby to settle?
*  Should I still be giving her the 1am feed while doing controlled crying or should we just omit it completely?

"It is slightly a complicated background so I will do my best at condensing it clearly.  
SO has 2 brothers, one who lives with us (D) and another who lives nearby (B).  Both brothers technically co-own the house with SO (although SO is the only one who literally paid for it).  SO and I have a baby on the way (next month) and B has a wonderful 5 year old daughter.  
B doesn't want anyone else to discipline his daughter (including saying No she may not use our computer, or that she shouldn't touch the stove because it is hot).  I understand this to some degree, in their house we have no right to tell the kid what to do.  D does try to keep her in line when he is watching her but gives in to not paying attention once B is around.  There are two issues in addition to the general misbehaving all children that age tend to do, one is that she is partially deaf and parents don't make her wear her hearing aids, and she was diagnosed on the autism spectrum (although it would be high spectrum if it wasn't an incorrect diagnoses).  
With the new baby on the way, I'd like to set some new ground rules that she should have to follow as well as our own child.  I want to sit with both brothers and discuss this, but I'm not sure how to do it.  Things like no running or throwing in the house, no going on the computer, food and drinks are to be at the table, kitchen is off limits are the kinds of rules I'm looking to set up.    In my opinion, these should be rules anyway, but no one (except SO) likes to listen to me on these things.  Now she is getting a lot bigger, and I have my own kid that I need to think of.
Do any of you have some advice to help me out with how to go about approaching this?  I don't want them to think I'm trying to take over how to raise their kid/niece but I don't want to be telling my kid no and having her doing it or D to say its ok when SO and I aren't there.",6

And now we're going to have another one? †What the fuck was I thinking???? †I have zero excitement about this coming child. I'm mainly excited to not be pregnant anymore. I find myself wishing more and more that I'll just die in childbirth. Not really looking for advice or anything I do have a long ugly history of depression and I have been seeking out treatment. The earliest appointment I could get was a month from now. I even went to the emergency psych ward this morning and what I got was... A referral to call the place where I can't get an appointment for a month. The OB who oversees the midwife practice I go to isn't comfortable writing me a prescription for antidepressants. †So Yeah I'm one of those people who should never have had kids and will most likely be horrifically miserable the rest of my life. It sucks",6
"I've been exclusively breast feeding my daughter for the last 7 months and I've been extremely lucky in that we haven't had any problems while doing so. Now the last three days she's refused to nurse during the day, only leading up to her bedtime whereas prior to she would nurse after breakfast, lunch and dinner and occasionally a night time feed. 
I've been trying to stick with her regular schedule but every time I try to nurse her, she'll go to latch on but just as her face/mouth gets close she turns away from it and refuses to nurse no matter how many times i try to get her attention. When its the feed right before bedtime she does the same motion but eventually latches on after a second or two. 
It's beyond bizarre behaviour that is completely unlike my daughter when it's come to nursing. Even while teething she would still nurse (taking breaks in between, never refusing or diminished appetite) so I was starting to think that maybe she's getting ready to cut a tooth through because she has been more irritable the last week and a bit (more than she's ever been these last three months). I haven't changed the amount of solids she's been eating either but the only thing i've slowly been adding in is about a quarter cup of water in a sippy cup. 
Ultimately I'm thinking because she is teething and her poor gums are hurting and now that she's had water out of the sippy where she doesn't need to make the sucking motion as much so it isn't as painful unlike nursing. But I was hoping there would be another mama here that I could bounce these ideas off of or who may have experienced the same/similar thing?! I would love to continue nursing exclusively but in the same breath I want to make sure she's getting the proper nutrients etc!! ",6
"I've been experimenting with healthy (and hopefully delicious?!) food for my little fella (16 months). †I thought I'd share one of my recent successes as it's quick and reasonably healthy, and the target audience actually wolfs it down. † But I'd love to get more ideas from you Mommits and Daddits out there. My latest trick is wholemeal pancakes PLUS. The basic recipe: 1 egg (beaten) Keep beating and add about 75g wholemeal flour. Add enough whole milk to make it the texture you like †(runnier for greater pourability) Maybe a tsp of neutral oil (like grapeseed or canola) Maybe tsp or half of that of baking powder. Just keep using those electric beaters till the mix is smooth. Then put spoons of it in your frying pan (with as little oil as you like), and make like a pancake cooking master. That's the basic, and it went down very well (even though I thought it was a bit bland). †BUT, this recipe lends itself very well to a whole heap of PLUS variations. †The ones I tried were: *pancake PLUS cheese and veg (grate cheese, steam some mixed frozen veg (blend or not), and chuck into basic mix) * pancake PLUS fruit (I smooshed banana and frozen raspberries into mine, but I suspect there's a whole world of fruit combos that would be delishus! So, what are the things you've put together that you would consider scrumptious and healthy? †",4
"I've been home with my son since he was born about 4 months ago. I returned to work part-time this week and most of the time my son is with his dad, but he spends 2-3 hours twice a week with my mother-in-law. We have been visiting his grandma on average twice a week since he was a few weeks old, but this week was the first time leaving him there. It hasn't gone completely smoothly.

Grandma has called my husband in tears because she can't get the baby to stop crying. While my son has taken a bottle from her in our presence,  he won't when they are alone together. Yesterday was the third time alone with his grandma, and my husband said our son didn't calm down until they left grandma's house. Once they were home, my son took from my husband the bottle he had refused from his grandma. 

Personally,  I think it'll get better with time as he and his grandma get used to the new arrangement. I feed my son before I drop him off,  so it's not like he's actually going hungry over there. I think she's not used to his cues yet and he's not used to being soothed by her. I also think she's being a bit dramatic... babies are gonna cry sometimes! He's only there a few hours,  and is definitely not crying the whole or even half the time. 
My husband and his mom think she should start coming over here to babysit so the baby is in a familiar environment. Does this seem like a good idea, or should we stay the course? Anyone else faced similar issues when first leaving your baby with a caregiver? ",6
"I've been loving the Gerber puffs and little yogurt melts. The Bubs loves them, they melt in his mouth so less of a choking hazard, they're convenient little snacks when we go to the store and he's getting a little fussy and best part, when I forget to take them out of the diaper bag they don't turn into a rotten mushy mess.  Only problem, the sugar!  I looked at the ingredients and sugar is listed second or third. I really would rather not give Bubs extra sugar yet if I can help it.  Does anyone have a recipe for a melty, convenient, non rotting little snack I could make instead?",2
"I've been saying I don't want kids since what feels like the dawn of time. I've seen far too many of my friends and families lives get destroyed by children, and just the mere IDEA of me possibly being pregnant (even just thinking 'what if?') sends me into tears of absolute PANIC. I don't want to go through pregnancy, I don't want my life taken away from me, I don't want to be permanently disfigured and I don't want my whole life to be doomed to serving some little rat who never appreciates it while my dreams, goals, money and career fall by the wayside.
Now, to me and my boyfriend. When we started dating he was very vocal about not wanting kids and even spoke like he was fully open to the possibility of never having them ever. I thought perfect! We've even been planning to build a house together. Recently we'd been looking at methods of non-hormonal contraception and I narrowed it down to getting my tubes tied. When I brought it up to my boyfriend, to my surprise, he went very quiet, then said You know I'll probably want kids some day Cue internal freakout. We had a discussion about it later and he expanded he wouldn't even think about having kids until 10 years down the track  that he didn't want to break up over it My biggest fear is what if I don't? What if I don't change my mind  we don't break up I know I'm going to sound like an idiot but this man is my dream human being. I had an idea in my head growing up of the sort of man I wanted to marry one day and somehow  against all odds Is it too early to be worrying about this? Will I ever be able to change his mind? Will he ever be able to change mine?
What do I do?""",6
"I've been trying to keep my ever dwindling milk supply up, but I don't want to keep making lactation cookies, and brewers yeast in water tastes like drinking out of a swamp. I started making coco with it, and thought I would share.
All measurements are approximate. I just use a normal dinner spoon.
2 to 3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon coco
1 tablespoon brewers yeast
2 to 3 tablespoons powdered milk Stir these ingredients together in the bottom of your mug, and add enough tap water to moisten it. If you don't premix the dry ingredients, you will get little unpleasant balls of powder floating on top of your drink.
Add about 8 ounces of hot water (for coco) or coffee (for mocha). Stir and enjoy.
The drink will still be a bit bitter, bit it is much more paletable than straight yeast, and ready in a hurry, unlike cookies.",6
"I've been working with a therapist on postpartum depression after having my first child 9 months ago. However, I feel like I can't talk to her about this because I have a face and a name to her. So, the sweet anonymity of the internet. 

Aside from when I was briefly off of birth control, I've never had a large sex drive. I'd actually initiate sex maybe 5-6 times a year. Since having my kid, I'm bordering between being neutral to outright repulsed by the idea of sex. Maybe once in the past 9 months I was briefly horny, but not enough to actually do anything about it.  I haven't masturbated since the second trimester.
Much as I hate to admit it, I know a lot of my attitude is hormonal. I don't know what to do about that. I'm too far post to blame the postpartum hormones any more. I have an IUD right now, which is supposedly about as low as hormone birth control can get. I guess I could look into another product. I know I'll screw up pills.
Part of my issue is some form of PTSD. The c-section was emotionally scaring. I failed at breast feeding.  I feel like everything female"" about me is disgusting and inconvenient and broken. I do have a chronically poor body image  which the extra 20 baby pounds and c-section scar are not helping However I feel like I can't do anything to work on my body image/extra pounds because every work out is time taken away from the baby. Every diet plan is time and energy and money taken away from the baby. I'm the primary bread-winner in the household  I've tried new routines. Nothing. It's gotten to where I feel completely uninterested in even bothering. If it wasn't for a desire to try to stoke my sex drive for my husband's sake  I would be completely content being fat and sexless the rest of my life.  My husband and I have been together for a long time. He says he'd never leave me just for lack of sex and I believe him. But but he's asked repeatedly for permission to go to a ""massage"" parlor. He's admitted though  that just getting a hand-job may not be satisfying. He is worried that The last time the massage parlor conversation came up  I asked him to be patient he was ready for sex again and I was not. That sex was actually bad. Like  I cried-myself-to-sleep bad. We talk about why that session was bad. He made adjustments and we have a session a few days later that was ok. So we are trying. I feel so helpless I'm worried that he's getting tired of dealing with me and my brokenness. When I ask him directly he says no  reading into stuff way too far.  I don't know what to do but I feel like I burdening him and making things worse so I try to shut him out from my emotional state and deal with it on my own. I know that's not the way to go Ugh.

"I've just gone back to work after my all too short FMLA 60 work days. We have the kiddo in a home daycare. Yesterday she took hardly any breastmilk as she has only had a bottle twice before. That's my fault and I assume it will get better as she gets hungry she'll have to try the bottle.

My real question is the hellish time we pent last night. She woke *screaming* every 1.5-2 hrs (she had been sleeping 4 hour stretches and only slight cries to alert us that she was awake). Every time she wanted the breast but I'm not sure she was wanting to eat so much as comfort nurse.

"I've never been the most stylish person, and I've never been a huge make-up-y, awesome hair kind of girl, but I always got by and looked good when I put in the effort. Lately it's gotten bad yall. 
Between the baby, the house work, family obligations, and working full time as primary breadwinner (I'm a nurse so pony tail and scrubs) when am I supposed to get time to look good? 
I plucked my eyebrows yesterday during the baby's nap and that was an accomplishment lol... Nails look like crap. Toes neglected.

Not sure why, I've tried a different brands of contacts and solutions), clothes need easy boob-access. I've never felt like I looked good in glasses. Breastfeeding is making me lose too much weight which makes me self-conscious, but I'm trying really hard to step up my eating game.

"Just a random thought today, so bare with me ..
After being a mom for 2 years now, I have come to realize just how competitive the mom world actually is. When I first became a mom, I thought to myself wow  I always made all of his meals myself from scratch  I made and revised schedules for him as he grew so he would always be ""well adjusted""  I just really REALLY tried to be the best mom possible. And to my credit  I still do really try and I love motherhood with all my heart. That being said  after the ""oh hey look at me  they do MORE  and they make it look so god damn easy. And then they go as far as to write blogs about it or post a ton of pictures of every little thing they are doing right on any social media they can get their hands on. I'm not saying they shouldn't be proud  but since when did motherhood become a competition? When did motherhood become something that you needed to always one-up the other? If you aren't breast feeding your a bad mom. If you aren't able to keep a strong marriage together while working from home while taking care of 3 kids  you're a bad mom. If every meal you feed your kids isn't organic and homemade you're a bad mom. If you don't work out and stay up to date with all the latest fashion trends and wear high heels while out shopping  you're (somehow) a bad mom. We have all seen it. We have all heard it. We have all felt it. Hell we may have even SAID it.  It may seem like I'm jealous of these ""do-it-all"" moms  and shit I think my point is that if we all don't portray ourselves as the perfect moms that can do it all  we start to get judged. Maybe not from people who don't have kids  or are lazy or that whatever they are doing is just so much better than whatever it is you are doing. I think being a mom should be about doing what is best for your child and doing what is best for YOU. I think we should all try and emulate the dad world a little bit and be there for each other for support  rather than for criticism and passing judgement. Sometimes I feel as if motherhood is just some weird extension of high school ... """,6
"Just food for thought. I'm not a teacher, and I'm not sure why the estimates for back-to-school purchasing aren't enough to cover the whole year (not enough storage space? stuff like markers and glue sticks dry out?), but I've seen this mid-year supply drought (usually with Kleenex) several times now at my son's school.
Teacher's aren't made of money and times are tough. They're often left with two options when running low on critical items: pay out of pocket or spam kids' backpacks with pleas for donations. This year my wife and I decided to be proactive and e-mailed the teacher to see if she had any needs. The response was something along the lines of: *We desperately"" need glue sticks
This last part is especially heartbreaking since the entire wishlist came to less than $50 US. It's sad how that amount of money can make such a big difference. My wife and I aren't made of money either  but it's a totally reasonable slice of our holiday gift-giving budget. (And let's face it Not only that if your kid's teacher is as awesome as ours is

"Just for some background, I've never done purees with my children. I think my mom does when she watches my kids, but she also really put up a good fight when I told her no bottles after age 1 for my daughter (she thought I should ""baby"" my babies). My suggestions and ideas are somewhere between stage 2 and 3 food and BLW. I do this because I don't see the point in purees and also, I'm lazy and don't feel like making 2-3 different meals in my house per meal (2 adults, 1 preschooler, 1 baby). I make 1 meal for everyone, usually. So with that in mind, this post is for baby food. I'll make another post with toddler and preschooler ideas. Here goes!Note: I buy organic whenever possible. Just my preference.Starter Solids (~6+ months)I'm a big fan of mashing. The following veggies can be steamed then smooshed. If it's too thick, thin with breastmilk or formula (also adds somne nice calories). Also, try baking or roasting as a variation. It changes up the flavor a little.- Sweet potatoes (I LOVE baking these! Wash well, poke skin a few times with fork, line baking sheet with foil and spray with non-stick spray, bake @ 425 degrees for about an hour, turning once, peel skin)- Butternut squash- Carrots- Broccoli (I usually add this to something else instead of just by itself. It's not starchy enough to stand on it's own if you want to avoid pureeing)- Any other veggies you like that are in season!- Avocado does not need to be cooked. Just mash and feed or cut into little pieces and feed.- Fruit that is soft enough to mash with a fork does not need to be steamed. Just mash and feed. I generally only steam fruit if I'm making homemade applesauce.Steel Cut Oatmeal (~6+ months)You can skip baby cereal all together if you want (I did). Steel Cut Oatmeal is easy and much healthier. Has a nice texture and iron. Make on the stove with water, thin with breastmilk or formula after cooking. Add smashed fruit as a nice mix in. Do not use honey to sweeten until after age 1 (see my note about honey in the yogurt section).Homemade Yogurt (~8+ months)- Plain Whole Milk Yogurt- Unsweetened Applesauce to sweeten- Any combination of fork smashed blueberries, strawberries, avocado (yes, sounds weird but the kids love it), banana, pear, peaches, grapes.Put it all in a bowl and mix. Any extra will keep in the fridge for 1-2 days when covered with a tight lid.Notes: - Yogurt: either regular style or Greek for more thickness/texture - higher protein too; I get the big organic tubs at Trader Joe's - it's like $3.50 and lasts FOREVER.- Applesauce: again I buy Trader Joe's Organic Unsweetened Applesauce because it's just crushed apples with no other ingredients. You get a 24oz jar for about $3. Or you can use whatever brand you like or you can make your own (peel and core apples, steam well, crush/mash to your preferred consistency - exactly like making smashed potatoes).- Using Honey to Sweeten: After age 1, you can use honey to sweeten instead of applesauce. Do not give your baby honey until after they turn 1 because of botulism risk, not even in cooked food.- Fruit smooshing: No need to steam anything. Just get ripe fruit that is soft enough to smoosh. For berries, you can use fresh or frozen.Dinner Combos (~9+ months):This is a bit more free form and meant to spark ideas for you and not so much a recipe. I want to give you ideas on how you can take what you are making for dinner and make it baby appropriate without having to cook multiple meals. Basically, take whatever protein you are having, mince it up, smash a starchy veggie and mince up any other veggies you are having and mix it all up. The key is to have a starch to make it all stick together. Sometimes I used applesauce as a binder if I don't have anything else.Recent combos I've made my son:- Fish Tacos - Baked breaded fish, black beans, finely chopped cabbage. Mash and mix.- Chicken, sweet potato, and broccoli- Beef, butternut squash, carrots- Stir Fry Night - Chicken, carrots, rice, broccoli (set some aside for baby before adding the stir fry sauce)- Salmon, broccoli, potato- Pasta night - pasta, sauce, cheese - cut/minced up.Snack ideas - cheese, puffs (Plum Organics), cheerios (or whatever version you buy - Trader Joe's O's are pretty good), yogurt drops (Plum Organics), straight applesauce, grapes (halved or quartered)Hope you find some of these ideas helpful. :)PS - Yes, I pretty much do all my shopping at Trader Joe's. Totally not obvious, right?",1
"Just got off the phone with a friend who bragged that his 10-day old slept through the night last night.

"Just want to double check... first kid, so I question myself a lot!
Daughter is 10 months old, she has always been a very good eater. She would chop down anything, she loves to discover new tastes and she has a very wide variety of food. She is eating chunks and she feeds herself with her hands.
4-5 days ago, she started to reject her food. She is eating a few pieces, then she starts to play with it, to throw food on the ground. If I put a piece in her mouth, she rejects it half of the time.
To me, it is very clear that a child only have what is in his plate. If he doesn't like it, there is nothing else until next meal.
Just want to make sure she is not too young to do that. If she doesn't eat, I remove what is left after 30 - 45 min. She drinks a bigger bottle before nap or bedtime to make up for the calories she didn't eat.
Am I doing ok or should I offer something else to eat?

"Last night, I was trying to be good and not stay out too long while visiting a friend who was going out of town for 2 weeks. But before I knew it, 4 am arrived and I headed home. Obviously, when you have a kid, you get up pretty darn early. So 7, the usual wake up time, rolls around and in like clockwork comes my 3 year old to snuggle with me for an hour before she starts asking for breakfast. Well after only having been asleep for 3 hours, I knew I wouldn't be able to follow that routine and get up when she needed me to. Well, I fell back asleep and as a mom, you probably can surmise what a disastrous mistake that was. I remember waking up and falling back to sleep twice, and by 10 I was finally awake enough to get out of bed. When I did, I had quite a few surprises for me. A kitchen floor full of cornmeal, orzo mixed with dish washing detergent, parmesan all over my living room table, and she had taken it upon herself to get a breakfast of buttered bread and spaghetti from last night. And I couldn't get mad at her. I mean i rarely stay out that late, most of the time making it home by 1..but last night was a rare exception I needed to relax. And of course, my little chef decided to destroy my kitchen, leaving my bathroom, her room and the other rooms well enough alone. And I can't help but be a bit amused and proud of how my 3 year old made herself a meal without me. She does this often, making small meals when I am too busy to make her a snack. Usually just PB&J, but today, she had a meal. Anyways, silly to think I was proud of her for being so independent because I should have been able to get up and make her breakfast. And that is my confession",3
"Last year, I made a decision. Some might call it extreme. Some might love the idea. I was just dreading the thought of having all that candy in the house around my (then) 3 and 5 year olds.

But then I start thinking about how that candy will be lingering - how the kids will be asking for it every night until it's gone, and how my wife and I, ourselves, will be tempted to snack on it. Extra calories for us, extra cavity opportunities for the kids...all in all just a bad thing.
So I came up with Candy for Dinner."" The kids can eat one piece of candy the night of Halloween. The rest of it will be their dinner the next evening. Whatever they cannot eat (no returning to the table after you've left either!) gets put in the trash TL;DR - My kids eat their Halloween candy for dinner. What they don't eat gets thrown out.

"Literally just received this, as a reply from a petition i signed and shared.
This came from this reddit post: http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/woijz/phoenix_hanson_is_a_nonverbal_five_year_old_with/
Hey Randus,
As of July 19th, all four news agencies listed on the petition have been in contact with Craig & Nina. Three of the four came out and did interviews, which they aired immediately. The fourth talked about the case on air. During one of the aired reports, Phoenix's petition was mentioned.
After a month of silence, of no progress of any kind, in a little over a week's time, everything has changed for the Hansons. In a little over a week's time, little Phoenix is starting to get the justice he deserves and everyone that signed, shared and supported this family that maybe you knew and maybe you didn't, helped make that happen.
From Nina:
'Thank you so much to everyone who has signed this petition and has reached out with support and love. It has meant the world to my family, and has brought a sense of peace to have so many take part in this heartbreaking conversation about what can not happen in our classrooms.
This petition and this story is about so much more than one child. It's about every single boy and girl that finds themselves outside of a mainstream education and how they should never have to fear bullying or harm because of their differences. Parents who navigate the appointments and evaluations with love and patience should not have this fear in their gut placed there by so many horror stories about what sometimes happens in special needs classrooms. These children are exceptional and interesting and different, and they are hungry to learn and with the right teachers, in the right classrooms filled with patience and support they can flourish and thrive and their parents can celebrate and breathe easy. This is what should be happening and these are the stories we should be telling. That of success and support and community for all of our children.
Hopefully we can take this circumstance and strive for better. Phoenix‚Äôs Voice (www.phoenixsvoice.blogspot.com) is a new blog where stories about abuse and bullying in special needs classrooms can be shared. These stories are popping up everywhere, but they‚Äôre scattered. Together we can become a collective voice. This is a conversation that needs to happen, and it needs to happen loudly, because by discussing what‚Äôs terribly wrong we can begin to fix things. We can inform the parents with bouncing knees and choked back tears who are watching their babies walk away unable to offer words to comfort them. We can rage for the parents who sat across from a deputy listening as their world cracked open. We can rally for the teachers who fight for our kids in a system that doesn‚Äôt support them.
Thank you for sharing and for speaking up for those who can not with words. Out of tragedy we can create change and that is thanks to people like each one of you.""
To have or not to have a second child? That is the question. Looking for feedback from single child parents and parents that overcame the question and decided to have another.""
I think we're both pretty level headed and logical thinking and it's hard to analyze this in a way that results in a conclusive decision. I tend to feel like at some point we're either going to have a second child that's 5 plus years younger than our first or realize it's been so many years that we'd rather not have a second one and them be so far apart in age. Some of the reasons we're not an automatic ""yes"" to having a second one are.  very happy with our little guy. When we decided to have our first  daycare cost doubles on top of all the other cost of having a child. -Back to being more restricted on what you can and can't do. We're just now feeling like we can do pretty much whatever we want with our son. If we want to go to the lake  he loves it. If we want to go hiking to a waterfall? He loves it. Don't feel like cooking tonight? He can sit in a booth at a restaurant without issue  maybe? We love our son but he can sure test us at times and push both of our buttons like a pro. When we're having one of those extra rough days where we're both at our wits end with him. I can't help but think how much harder it could be if we had a second one. -Long term. Saving up for college for one child sounds a lot easier than two. Sending our son to private school should we decided we're not happy with the public schools would be an option with one child  not as possible with a second one. Education is very important to both of us. We want to provide the best we can for him.
Reasons we might like having another child.
-The love and joy we have for our son times 2. -Built in playmate for son. This a really the biggest factor probably. I don't know if it's ""right"" to give it as much weight as I'm inclined to do so.
The biggest single reason we still think at times a second child might be a good option is so our son can have a sibling. Don't know what to make of that. We both always have the never ending question from co-workers friends Whenever we say anything that doesn't say ""AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!"" the standard reply seems to be ""JUST DO IT!!"" and ""don't worry everything will work out"" which makes my wife and I laugh a bit as we're pretty hardcore planners and are very intentional with our actions especially when it comes to big decisions. what was the tipping point assuming it was planned?""",6

Little man is 16 months and reading to him has become one of my favorites. He even fell asleep the other day while. Was reading! His current favorite is dinner with oliva. I'd like to find board books for him. Ones that are long enough to be entertaining but not too long like The cat in the hat.,6

"Looking for advice/experiences. Almost 14mo woke up with what looks like hives-- clear line of red welts on her legs right outside her diaper, welts all over the back of her legs. Smaller and fewer spread out on her tummy, face and arms. We went to a party yesterday with lots of ppl and food so it's not surprising, but she never had an allergic rxn before. She's not acting unusual, not even scratching, no fever. I get children's benadryl, call for the dosage from her pedi. After a few hrs of taking it, the welts seem to be going away. We decide to give her a 2nd dose before bed after the recommended 6hrs. New welts are appearing on her face, but I can't tell if it's bc the first dose is wearing off or its getting worse. †Obviously, the best answer is take her to the Dr, but I'm wondering if anyone else has had any experience s--how long did it last, did it get worse, etc. I'm fairly sure this is a reaction and shes not showing any other problems.",6
"Me and my SO were at a restaurant having breakfast with our son and he was happily playing, laughing and trying out his first pancake. It was his fourth restaurant visit and he's only been cranky on one of them and I think that was because he was just getting over the croup. Before he was born I was pretty set about not taking him to restaurants because I have been to a few where someone's kid was yelling and screaming ruined the whole experience and made me just want to rush out of there.
As we were leaving we noticed the couple behind us were leaving too so I waited a little bit so we didn't bump into each other getting our things together. Then out of the blue the guy comes over and says something like You guys are doing a great job. You have one happy and nice young boy right there. Please take this. Your next coffee is on me!"" (he must have noticed I just went through about 6 cups while sitting there) He then does the slide money into my hand via a handshake thing and gives me $5. I was pretty shocked at this and wasn't quite sure what to do We put the money in our son's piggy bank and told him he can buy a toy with it later since he earned it for being so good. **TL;DR:** Our son was good and didn't scream in a restaurant and someone gave me $5 for it. I have never seen or heard of anything like this so I'm curious as to how common it is..""",6

"Mommit my almost 22 month old is not eating normally and I'm worried that she's developing a bad relationship with food. She used to try new things but now will push her food away, scream and cry or stand up in her high chair unless we give her three foods: blueberries, yogurt or oatmeal. These are the only foods she will eat in her high chair. She will occasionally eat Cheerios as a snack. She will throw whole meals on the floor after only a glance at them and I can't make her stop. We tried ending mealtime if she throws and she doesn't care. I feel like a short order cook, making her dinner and then backup dinner and just offering and offering and getting more screams. We've tried making meals together, eating at a kids table, eating meals together and eating the same, reinforcing how good it is. We put foods on her plate for several consecutive days so she can get familiar with it, no help. Nothing. She used to eat other foods but over the past few months has eliminated all non fruit foods. She's never eaten a raw vegetable. I'm frustrated and desperate for her to eat, I dread mealtimes.  The work and the waste is out of control. What can I do? She won't tell me what she wants, never seems to care if she skips multiple meals for days in a row. It's affecting our relationship and my life in general. ",2
"Mommit, I'm looking for your ideas and expertise in regards to feeding my 8 month old. I'm sort of flying solo as a first time mom and am a bit daunted by fears of allergic reactions (baby's dad has a loooong list of severe food allergies and I live in fear of anyphilaxis) and choking hazards. I try to read mommy blogs but there are so many conflicting beliefs out there that it's hard to know what's right. Example: I thought I wasn't supposed to introduce dairy (cow's milk) until Babbs is at least one- yet one blog just suggested I give him bits of cheese to eat. I haven't done that...but would it be ok to? Many blogs say he can soon start eating what we're eating... but how pureed does that food need to be to be safe for him? He has no teeth so far. Of course, we're following his allergist's suggestions for diet but even he's been kind of vague, and hasn't seen the baby since his 6 month appointment. So as a result, my kid lives on (and loves) sweet potato, butternut squash, pumpkin (it's a miracle he doesn't look like an Oompa Loompa) along with some oatmeal and fruits. He hasn't had any signs of food allergies yet- but I've been sticking solely to stuff his dad isn't allergic to (so, no green beans, carrots, peas, gluten). I'm worried that I'm putting him in a rut. What foods are ok to give a baby his age? What about teething biscuits? Thank you in advance! You've never let me down before. :) Edited to add: The majority of his diet is still booby milk and formula- but he's getting much more interested in solid foods these days.",2

"Moms, I am getting ready to take a short flight (less than 2 hours) with my 3 month old by myself.  Any tips or advice as to what to pack, what to check, and what to carry on?

I am not really a stroller person so it's more of a just in case item.  As I write this I am not even sure its necessary.  I will be staying in a beach condo with my parents for 4 days so we probably won't really go anywhere that would require a stroller.  
As far as the flying part goes, all I need is his birth certificate for security I think and he will sit on my lap so no extra seat needed.  I am going to upgrade to business class even though it is a short flight just in case he get fussy or hungry and wants to nurse.  Plus it will be nice to have more room in general.

We don't have the heart to do the cry it out method.
An hour or so later, he'll start to get cranky again and my wife tries again. We may end up doing this two or three times before he goes down. When he does go down, he may only be down for a couple hours before waking up crying. Half the time a quick breast feed works, other times we have to lay on the couch with a baby Einstein on until he falls asleep again.

I bumped him up to a bigger size swaddling blanket, but now he's wiggling so much in his crib (he spins around like Curly from the Three Stooges in his sleep) that he woke up anyway and I got paranoid that he would flip on his stomach and suffocate, so I took him out of the swaddle and put him in his sleep sack. Now he wakes up every hour and a half and I am going nuts. I don't know what to do. If I feed him and put him back in his crib, then I'm awake for another hour trying to fall back asleep. If I co-sleep with him so we can both sleep while he nurses, he still wakes up and fusses and I have to put him back on the boob. I'm miserable.

"My 15 month old daughter made the transition to stage 1 and 2 foods well enough, but she still won't eat any stage 3 foods that have chunks in them.  When she sees it coming, she slaps at the spoon and turns away.  When she finally works up the courage to try a bite, she feels the small pieces in her mouth, gags, and wipes her hands on her tongue to get it out of her mouth.  I've also tried putting small pieces of things like bananas on her tray to see if she wants to feed herself, but so far she seems to only want to feed me.
Because of this, a normal feeding for her is a 4oz jar of baby food and around 6oz of whole milk with some water added here and there.  As of last weekend, her height percentile is a healthy 50 but her weight percentile is alarmingly low at 6.  As you can imagine, this is causing a lot of stress for my wife and I, although she is otherwise a very smart, happy, and extremely active baby.
Has anyone been in the same situation or have any tips to get her to chew her food?  The next step is early intervention feeding therapy if we can't make any progress soon.  Thanks.

Update for anyone finding this via search later on (she is now almost 2).  We just kept offering her foods but not trying to force much on her and she is doing better at eating solids.

This means that he has severe allergic reactions (but not life threatening) to a whole host of different foods such as: milk, soy, wheat, corn, cashews (severe), eggs (severe), peanut, scallop, shrimp, walnut, clam, cod and likely gluten. 
He‚Äôs not growing at the pace we think he should. He‚Äôs in the 10th percentile for height and weight. He‚Äôs incredibly smart and loving and all the things you‚Äôd hope for in a young boy but we worry that he‚Äôll have difficulties later in life if he is small of stature. We are going to ask our pediatrician for a referral to an allergist/nutrionist/immunologist (I‚Äôm not soliciting medical advice). 
* My fear is we‚Äôre not doing everything that we could so I‚Äôd like to hear about your experiences with children with food allergies and especially your experience with how your child developed, and what you did to help. 
TL;DR Son has food allergies. Not growing at pace he should. Have others had similar experiences

"My 2 and a half yr old daughter doesn't eat.  The only time she eats without being distracted by videos or books is if she's on periactin - we had a paediatric stomach dr prescribe it to her when she was a year and a half old.  When she's on it, she eats like a normal kid.  When we wean her off, she stops eating.  If we distract her with videos/books during meal times, we can get stuff into her, but if not, she doesn't eat.  When I let her be for a week or so (without periactin and without distracting her at mealtimes), her intake reduced drastically and she started losing wt.  Anyone had similar issues?  I'm at a point where I'm willing to try anything...",1
"My 2 year old has been waking up ever 30 minutes tonight and finally last time became almost inconsolable, pointing to his knee and crying that it hurts. After we got him calmed down, I took off his pajamas and took a look, no bruising or anything like that, and he didn't fall or hit it on anything unusual today either. 
He's 2 and small for his age, so I'm guessing and hoping it is just the pains typically associated with growing, but he couldn't even walk on it tonight. If he put any weight on it, he just collapsed to the ground in a heap of toddler tears and sobs. It broke my heart to watch.
Anyone ever experience this with one of their kids? I'm probably just being a paranoid parent, but it's tough to have a kid crying in pain on your shoulder for 45 minutes and not know if there's something more you need to do to help him feel better.
Gave him some Tylenol and cuddled until it kicked in, and now he's back to sleep, but just lets me wondering if he's growing or if there's something sinister afoot.
EDIT:  After the medicine kicked in, he slept very soundly the rest of the night.  He is already exhausted though, we've been trying to transition him to his new big-boy-bed, so he might have just passed out.  When he woke up this morning, he seemed like he was favoring it a bit, but nothing terribly noticeable unless you were looking for it, and by the time we left for daycare/work, he was completely fine.  He's got a doctor's appointment next week for his 2-year checkup, unless it gets bad again, I think we'll just check it then.",6

"My 3 (soon to be 4) yr old has got away without eating vegetables for so long.  I find kids who like vegeables are usually introduced to them early on.
Lets just say that boat sailed a long time ago .. is there any ways to get them into trying new foods?
He's a stubborn little thing and refuses to put anything near his mouth that he doesn't like the look of.
I've just had a battle (yeah I know, I dealt with it wrongly) and he's ended up in bed 30 minutes early without his favourite toy after downright refusing.
Bribes with desert don't work.  Adding cheese sauce doesn't work, putting colourful new things on his plate doesn't work.
I can SOMETIMES sneak away with getting a bit of cauliflower mashed in with some potato, or blending it into a soup, but any sort of non carb on the plate just blatently gets ignored and I'm starting to think it's really not the healthiest thing for him.
Any tips or suggestions from other stubborn parents?  Or should I just get over it and let him eat what he wants?",1
"My 3 year old daughter will be 4 in August. She has a history of NEVER eating her dinner. Very rarely she will eat. She'll eat hot dogs, sometimes chicken nuggets, never a cheeseburger (she'll pick off bread from the bun) or chicken or pork or meatloaf or anything else I try. She won't touch mashed potatoes or mac and cheese, but thank heavens she'll eat broccoli and corn, so that's what I try to stick with when I REALLY need her to eat something.
This is ONLY at dinner. Breakfast is great. Lunch is okay. Dinner is terrible. We eat dinner at 6. I pushed back our afternoon snack to 2:30, and by dinner she and her sister are practically starving (I thought moving the snack time would help her eat, but nope.) I try to include her. She helps me pick out what we eat for dinner, then she still wouldn't eat it. I try to get her to help me cook dinner, she isn't interested. She was excited the first couple of times, then just didn't care. I've sat with her and tried to talk with her (How about you eat *half* of your pork and your potatoes?"" ""No!"") I've taken toys  movies I don't know what to do. She's only 3  almost 4

I understand I need to stop the bottles at night, which my husband and I are in the process of doing. The big problem is she won't eat anything else, won't even try. She screams and yells that it is yucky, spits it out and will even make herself vomit to not eat. I'm really worried about it, I have spoken to professionals about it and they say it is just a phase and not to worry, it has been going on for a year and a half and can't help but worry.

My wife and I strive to give him the right food
Breakfast consists of:
* Home made oatmeal
* Whole grain toast with peanut butter
* fruit (grapes  strawberries
* yogurt
* watered down apple juice
* Flinstones vitamins (for me too!)
Lunch:
* soup
* veggies (raw carrots  cucumbers
* chicken breast
 left over meat from the night before * tuna
* whole grain bread
* fruit (pears  apples 
* whole wheat pasta
* Water
Supper:
In the same line as lunch  except one cup of milk. 
Snacks:
* Goldfish
* cucumbers
* chips 
* other snacky stuff

"My 3 yr old son has started playing"" at the dinner table Its quite frustrating and ends up us getting angry with him. It's not so much about what he's eating  but just him stuffing around. Any tips or uber tricks for getting kids to just sit down and eat?  I'd be happy if dinner took an hour.. instead of the two and a half hour growling session. >**Edit** Thanks guys... we'll probably use a combination of advice you've posted... Much of what you've said makes so much sense that I'm beginning to think I knew all that in the first place  but for some reason dinner time has been a blind spot for us.  I think probably because in his early years he had some semi serious food allergies and we had to accommodate him so much to get him to eat. I think tonight we'll ""push the reset button"" on our expectations and start a new consistent dinner time routine that will involve a lot less of us cajoling him and getting angry  and a lot more of him having to accept the consequences of not eating in a timely fashion when we do. We need to nip it in the bud before his 1 yr old sister starts to twig onto his behaviour.""",2

"My 4 month old has had two episodes were he screams like he's in agony. He's only screamed like this twice. It's the most painful scream/cry I've ever heard. It goes on for about 45 minutes. Today was the second time he did it and we gave him Tylenol 10 minutes in. The doctor recommended Tylenol when we called when this first happened. Here's what's happened both times: My mother was watching my son for two hours. Shortly after she left, he started screaming. The first time we were not home and we came right home when mom called. He had hives on his back when I took off his onesie. This second time, my wife was home with my mom the entire time. Mom just sat in the rocking chair while my son slept in her arms for the two hours. My son was dressed. They just sat in the chair. Each time he was with my mom for two hours. After about an hour, my son is back laughing and smiling. Like nothing happened. My mom comes over maybe a few times a week, maybe for 30 to 60 minutes. She's only watched my son for over an hour the two times there's been these episodes. We do think my son is teething. Red checks, blowing bubbles, chewing on everything. He's typically a regular baby and can be nursed to sleep when he's upset. My wife is on a very strict diet due to a few intolerances my son has. Could he be allergic to something my mom is wearing? Perfume? Laundry detergent? This just seems to be too much of a coincidence. Two hours with mom, screaming baby. Anyone have any thoughts?",6
"My 4 month old is killing me quickly - she goes to bed about 7:30, I then feed her at 10:00 when I go to bed, but she is up every half hour-hour the rest of the night, nursing every hour to hour an a half. The longest stretch of sleep I got last night was 45 minutes - I can't handle this and 10 hour work days for too much longer. However, after I feed her in the morning before I go to work she will usually go back to sleep for a longer stretch of time. Sometimes this 3 hours, sometimes 5. This morning she ate at 5:15 and then slept until 9. Is there a way to move that nice 3-5 hour stretch of sleep from morning to the middle of the night? Should I try to put her to bed earlier? Later? Will this pass? Will anything I do help? Thanks!",6
"My 4 year old son has never been a big eater, but for the past two weeks or so he's been particularly averse, almost phobic, of eating. He's been waking up every morning for the past couple of weeks asking whether it's okay if he doesn't eat anything that day, and when it's time for meals he appears very apprehensive and uneasy. In the past week he's vomited about six times in total on separate occasions, always during meals. He's never had a big appetite and has always hovered around the 10th percentile for weight/height. Not wanting to create an unhealthy obsession with food and eating, my stance so far has been to let him regulate himself and eat when he wants to and however much he wants, as long as he properly sits down at the table during regular family meal times. But the problem these days is that he can and will seriously go through a day without eating anything whatsoever unless I put my foot down, so my laissez faire approach isn't helping much. If he continues this way, he'll be considerably malnourished very soon, if not already. But then when I put my foot down (ie, say you MUST eat X number of spoonfuls of this"") he gets worse and even more averse to eating. I've talked to a gastroenterologist and three pediatricians in the past about the vomiting/the small appetite. †but it's never lead to anything concrete.

"My baby is 11 months old...almost a year:) and wants more real food instead of baby food. †What are some good meals to make her? †She has no teeth yet but eats pretty good. †Things I have made her: †I give her mandarin oranges and banana slices, sauteed spinach, peas but I want to give her more and start to stop baby food jars:) †Thanks!",2
"My baby is 15 months and loves cartoons..... Probably because I have let her watch them too much.  :(
I feel so guilty.
I work and my baby goes to a great home daycare. I think she watches zero TV there, so that's great. She plays with other kiddos, plays outside, draws, plays with toys, etc. I feel 100% confidant and happy with her daycare, so that's good.
I feel bad about the time I spend with her. When I'm home and on the computer or on my phone, the cartoons are on.  And, she's watching them... for a long time.... longer than I'd care to admit.
But, I work all day... And I feel like I should be interacting with her in a meaningful way or playing with her constructively at night. But, sometimes I want to decompress too. I want to play a silly computer game or check out Facebook. And, I do.  But, I feel bad.  I feel like I should spend more quality time with her when I'm home.
We do other things together.  We went to the beach this past weekend. I took her to a bounce house play land the weekend before that. And, I feed her meals, I play with her when I bathe her, and I play with her sometimes....... but when I'm not directly interacting with her, the cartoons are on.
It's just that when I'm in the house, I feel like I'm on the phone/computer too much and I let her be babysat by cartoons.  But, how do I stop???  The TV is so tempting and she likes it, and I can play around myself online. Should I set aside 30 minutes or an hour each night to play with her in her room (where there is no TV), so we can spend quality time together?
In some ways I feel like a bad mom for letting her watch a lot of TV, but also.... I don't think it's reasonable for me to expect myself to interact with her every moment of my free time.  Where is the balance? 
How much quality time playing and interacting do you set aside each day? What is a healthy amount of TV for a kiddo to watch?
I have felt stressed about this issue for a couple months now. My babe is getting a bit older and seems more focused on TV than when she was younger.
So.... I'd love to hear how other working mothers schedule a balance between decompressing and having time to enjoy your own pursuits and spending quality time with your kiddo(s).  And, how does TV fit into that mix?
EDIT: I'm extremely irritated about my grammar error in the title!!!  Sorry, ladies!  ",6
"My baby is 2 months old, EBF, and gets gassy when I eat beans/eggs etc.
His gas drops can be given upto 12 times a day at 0.3ml (around 10 drops) after every feed.
This works for us:
I give him 1 drop usually, 3 drops if I ate something really gassy. I give it before nursing, so it is easier to burp him after nursing.
So I'm just putting this tip out there for other mommas. This way you give way less of the medicine, and also you don't need to keep count if the number of feedings exceeds 12.",6
"My baby is almost 10 months old, still breastfed and she gags any time we have tried to feed her vegetables or meat.  (The pureed jarred baby food). I could easily dismiss it as just having a sensitive gag reflex but she will happily scarf down an entire jar of applesauce or peaches, she will gladly take small bites of ice cream, will gnaw on graham crackers etc.  Pretty much, if it is sweet, she eats it with no problem.  
The first time she did this we freaked out thinking she was choking because she turned really red in the face and started coughing.  After multiple times however, we have noticed if it isn't sweet, the second it hits her tongue she sits there, mouth wide open, coughing and gagging.  My other kids never did this so I am really at a loss.
It isn't a texture issue, it seems to purely be if she doesn't like the way it tastes.  Since today was Thanksgiving, I was giving her bites off my plate.  She happily swallowed the sweet potato casserole and anything else sweet"" but when I tried to give her bites of anything else
Does anyone have any tips?  I am truly at a loss and I don't know what to do.  I'm used to kids and babies spitting things out they don't like  I have no idea what to do with a baby who starts gagging and choking any time she tastes something she doesn't like.""",1
"My baby is almost 9 months and is ready to eat soft solids, not just mush. I need some recipe ideas as I have no idea what to do now. Last night I gave him steamed carrot and pumpkin and cut it up into small pieces. Simple and cheap recipes preferably, as I'm no chef and don't have a huge budget. ",4
"My baby is just short of nine months old. I have noticed recently that my milk supply has been decreasing. I know this is in part due to him not nursing as much at night now.  He has slowly been weening him self and is less interested in nursing and mostly wants actual food during the day too. All this is fine I don't mind that he wants to eat but because he is nursibg less my supply has greatly decreased and now I feel like even when he does nurse I'm not producing enough for him. My main question is because he is already 9 months is it okay to start transitioning him to whole milk (i have a bit of a frozen supply) or do I need to do formula till hes 12 months? I would really prefer to avoid having to transition him to formula if its only for a few months and he will transition again to milk. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Even how to re-increase my supply.
Edit: thank you everyone for all the info and suggestions.  I have a lot to look in to and think about. I really woukd prefer to keep breatfeeding so I will be focusing on that for now and if I can't get my supply up I will at least have a lot of info for when I go talk to my gp about supply issues and transition option.

"My baby is now 3.5 months old. He had reflux really from the day he was born (home birth) he was vomiting a lot and from 3 days old he started vomiting bile (bright yellow) so he was admitted into hospital for a few days as they thought he had a blocked or tangled bowel. It now seems it was Reflux. So after following various pieces of advice"" some greatWell here goes here are my Top Ten Tips
1. Speak/Visit to your Health Visitor or/and Doctor to share your concerns although don't let them just tell you to ""ride it out"" as there are steps that can drastically help a reflux baby (as well as be a God send for the parents). Don't let your baby suffer!
2. Discuss the possibility of changing milk (if formula fed) or making changes to mum's diet if breast feeding. The majority of children with Reflux have an underlying intolerance or allergy.
3. Try to keep baby upright as much as possible (my son still can't be laid horizontal without being sick). There are wedges you can buy but I haven't used these I tend to use the bouncer for daytime naps and use a V pillow when on the changing mat.
4. When feeding baby ensure they are positioned in an almost sitting position.
5. Burp regularly - I used to burp every ounce at the beginning but know my son is older I only burp him mid way through bottle and at end.
6. Invest in some baby dribble bibs. As most reflux babies regularly posset a dribble bib is a must so that the baby still looks funky and their clothes stay dry. I really like the bandana bibs from Bibs Bandana for this as they have a fleece back and cotton front so the bib can be worn for quite a length of time.
7. Make sure the cot is raised on one end so baby isn't flat. I just put books under the cots legs at top end I think this is safer than raising the mattress.
8. I was prescribed a feed thickener to put in my son's bottle - this is my TOP TIP as it has made a massive difference and stopped most of the projectile vomiting.
9. Take up offers of help from friends and family - caring for a reflux baby can be demanding
10. Enjoy your baby realise that this stage will pass and they are ""healthy""

"My baby is only two weeks old so maybe I'm jumping the gun and this will sort itself out, but for the last three nights between 10PM and 11PM his feedings have become very difficult. He cries and whines and screams while he sucks and there doesn't seem to be anything we can do about it. It seems like the milk might be coming out too fast - his sucking is sort of frantic and gulpy. We take him off and burp him often while this is happening, but as soon as he latches back on the crying starts again. **Every other feeding throughout the day is fine**, but for whatever reason the one right before we go to bed (when mom is the most tired) he just doesn't want to cooperate. Is this normal?
On a somewhat related note, my wife is experiencing some symptoms that might be related to PPD. I'm aware that baby blues"" are normal and last about 6 weeks so again this is probably a bit early to be concerned She was crying hysterically (not new she's been extremely emotional) and said that she feels **""detached""** from the baby and that sometimes she **doesn't care** to hold him and that she *makes herself* try to hold him even if she doesn't want to. I feel compelled to mention that she doesn't ACT this way. She seems great with him She also said that she felt like feeding him is the one thing she is supposed to be able to do and when she can't do it she feels extremely inadequate. I feel like part of this is because she had to have a C section and hasn't been able to get up and do everything that I'm doing so she feels like I am doing more work and all she does is feed him and sometimes she can't even get that right. What should I do? When is the right time to bring these issues to the attention of a medical professional? Sorry for the throwaway - just trying to protect my wife's privacy""",6
"My baby was born 6 and a half months ago via c-section after a 38 hour induced labor and only 3 cms of dilation. 
She was in the hospital for two months, and two days after I left the hospital I was visiting her and I went to the bathroom and I noticed that my pants were soaked around my waist. I lifted up the bit of belly flab and looked at the incision, which was sewed/staples shut internally (I believe anyways, it was just a line with no visible stitches or staples) It was dripping brown fluid from the left side. I immediately went to the ER next door where they opened up the corner and packed it with gauze. 3 days later the other side opened up and they opened it all the way. I had a couple abcesses inside and an infection. I visited the doctor weekly and my mother took care of it at home, packing it daily or twice daily depending on what the doctor said, and took every precaution with being sterile. 
It finally almost closed up after 3 months, when I went back to my OB to look at it. I saw a new resident, who proceeded to clean it using TAP WATER before I realized what he was doing, and had no idea how to bandage it up. After I left there, several days later I noticed blue-green discharge coming from it. I started going to a wound care clinic who told me I had Pseudomonas (sp?), an infection commonly received from doctor offices and hospitals, and staph. 
Anyways, to make a long story slightly shorter, its now been 6 and a half months and it is FINALLY almost closed up, only about 1 cm wide now. I've gained over 80 pounds, due mostly to lack of exercise  (I could barely move it was so painful), and bad diet (after taking care of baby all day I barely had it in me to cook, so we ate a lot of take out and frozen foods. Though I will say some of it was just laziness and a bit of depression)
I feel this has changed my life so much, and I do blame the doctors office for part of it, though not all. I was not instructed on any after care for the c-section incision, and I did not have optimal care afterwards. I was seeing a medicaid covered OB and they were so overbooked every day it was literally a 3-5 hour wait even when you got there at your appt time, before you saw a doctor. I understand they can't keep track of everyone. I don't entirely blame them though, I'm sure it was also bad luck and who knows what else that caused it. My weight gain is entirely on me, I should have found a way to do what I could to keep myself maintained. 
This wasn't intended as a woe is me story, I just wanted to know if this has happened to anyone else, or if I was just some weird anomaly, and I also kind of wanted to share what happened with someone. I wouldn't change it at all though, I feel it made me stronger, not to mention I have the most wonderful baby girl in the world. She is worth every second of it.

"My boyfriend and I welcomed a beautiful little girl into the world a little over 2 weeks ago. Despite many discussions with him throughout the pregnancy, I have discovered we have very different parenting styles.
My boyfriend had the you can spoil a baby"" mentality and firmly believes in letting her fuss to wear herself out. I rarely let her cry before picking her up. She's barely 3 weeks
I've been exclusively breastfeeding also. I feed her on demand. My bf insists on a two hour schedule and implies I'm over feeding her. I've also began cosleeping because it's way easier to sleep at night when I can nurse laying down. He hates it and thinks it dangerous and while I kind of agree and never planned to cosleep it's honestly been a lifesaver. Now I don't expect us to always agree on everything but I'm beginning to get irritated by him.

"My child has always needed to be very close to me, so it was more out of desperation than any ideal that I got her involved in the kitchen.

"My child was started showing symptoms that led to a diagnosis of a rare form of food allergies when she was just a couple months old.

"My daughter (10 months, almost 11) throws a temper tantrum whenever I leave her in her crib, and frequently when I just leave the room she's in if she can't just follow me. Sometimes she will be ok, if she is sitting with someone else she is comfortable with or absorbed in playing with her toys, but in her crib the second I take my hands off her she starts screaming. She usually sleeps in bed with us, and only sleeps in her crib when we can lay her down there without waking her up, but I try to put her in the crib with a couple of toys while I make something to eat or switch over a load of laundry, so she spends a decent amount of time in there - but it hasn't made much difference. She is crying right now as I write this :( does anyone have experience helping their LO be comfortable on their own for a few minutes at a time?
tl;dr - 10mo screams when left alone, what do I do?",6
"My daughter (13mo) isn't a good eater. She's very distracted and picky. Anyway, we usually put food right on her tray but want to use plates and bowls so she learns to eat from them. She insists on spilling the contents immediately. I tired the kind that suction to the tray but they didn't work. They were actually worse because the harder she pulled, they popped off the tray and food went everywhere. Am I expecting her to do something she isn't ready for?",6
"My daughter (20m) contracted HFMD from a kid in our neighborhood and I only noticed the symptoms last night after brushing her teeth. I noticed it hurt her to brush her teeth so I looked in her mouth and she had the blisters. I called her ped and they said just to make sure she stays hydrated with pedialyte if she won't drink anything and to give her tylenol and Ibuprofen. That was all fine and well last night, I could comply, except I didn't have pedialyte. But, she took the tylenol and was able to drink so, she was fine. This morning, I realized I had no more tylenol. She wouldn't eat or drink anything and she has huge blisters around her lady bits. I still don't have pedialyte.

"My daughter adores Minecraft on creative mode where she can't be hurt by enemies, can construct houses, spawn all sorts of animals, feed animals, cook food, etc.

"My daughter and her two friends without permission hacked a huge section of our redtip hedge to increase the size of their fort. I noticed it after dinner when I was making sure everything was put away. I was livid, sure about the hedge, but mostly by the fact that she didn't ask for permission. This is totally unlike her. 
First I had her remove all of the cut branches from the fort and put them in the backyard, then pick up and throw away most of the collected junk in the fort. 
Right now she is showering and getting ready for bed while I cool off. I never raised my voice but made sure she understood this is not acceptable. 
I am thinking of taking away her iPod touch for a week, no TV for 3 days (not a huge deal because she barely watches it) and no playing with friends until Friday. 
This feels like too much because she is such a great kid but I am super upset with her poor choice.

"My daughter decided she wanted to be potty trained at 2 years, 5 months and it went pretty smoothly.

"My daughter has always been great at eating. I know parents that have to fight their toddlers at every meal to get them to eat but we've NEVER had that with our daughter. But my concern is in the opposite direction: I'm worried that she eats too much. Childhood obesity is an epidemic in this country and I don't want her to develop unhealthy eating habits. She's by no means fat, she's in the 50th percentile for weight, but it's the habits down the line that concern me. At about every meal she asks for more, sometimes three or more times. When we have people watch her, they always tell us she was great. At home she will sometimes say ""all done"" and hand us her plate/bowl so I feel like I should be able to trust her judgement on when she's full. But other times I think she eats way too much and then I can hear her stomach getting in a fight with her later in the evening.†Now granted †the things we give her aren't junk.

Always offered a sippy cup of water. Usually on takes a few sips. Before nap: 4oz cup of whole milk Nap is 2-3 hours Mid afternoon: smaller meal, maybe some puree and whole fat yogurt and some rice snacks (only a few)+ water in cup Dinner: some boiled veggies, some mashed potato, a bit of chicken or fish.+ water in cup. Bed time: 8oz whole milk bottle. She does not sleep with a bottle, and I have tried prunes with occasional limited success. Any ideas would be great, I really feel bad for her!",2
"My daughter has going on a sleeping-in-her-crib strike.  Most nights, she winds up between my husband and me in our bed.  She's never been a great sleeper, and has slept 8 hours straight a total of 3 times in her life.  
Between about 5 months and 8 months, she slept in her crib though.  She would wake up every hour in the evening (from around 7:30 or 8:00pm) and then sleep from about 11pm to about 4am, nurse and then go back to sleep until about 6 am.   Those were the good old days.
We had to make two transatlantic trips since November and so between November and now, she has gone through 4 weeks of jet-lag adjustment.  In October-November, she also cut 6 teeth in 8 weeks.  During our travels, she began to refuse to sleep in her crib (we had travel crib on the first trip, but on the second we had to make last-minute arrangements and for half the trip she could only stay in our bed).  Since we have been back for about 3 weeks now, she has pretty much refused to stay in her crib.
Some background in case it is relevant. My daughter has always been very active.  She eats well, and is tall but light for her age (according to the growth curves -- 70th percentile for height, 10th for weight).  At that time when they should"" learn to sleep  in addition to the travels  she also is in that learning-to-walk phase that I have read causes sleep problems. I still breastfeed; if she is still very hungry we'll give her a bottle of formula before bed (sometimes my pumping schedule at work and her feeding schedule don't align and I won't have enough milk in the evening.  She eats lunch at around noon She won't nap in her crib either -- she will fall asleep on her own either in the car seat or the cradle swing.  I don't want to use either for night time sleep. Right now  she sleeps very very restlessly at night  and put her in the crib  she will wake up crying 20-40 minutes later and cannot settle.  Even if I bring her to our bed  she can take 30-60 minutes to fall asleep  and that's when she tries to lie down and get comfy.  She's gone back to nursing at 2:00 am and 6:00am. It can take 30 mins after a feed for her to settle again. My husband and I can live with her sleeping with us for a while  although it's not ideal but we are not there yet. What I have done is make it clear that I won't tolerate tantrums. If she lies down in her crib and tries to sleep  I will stay with her until she is off in happy sleepy land.  But if she throws a tantrum that I have put her down  I walk out and let her cry for a minute   and on the second night she did sleep in her crib  even after waking for a nursing session at 2:00am.  But the next night  she didn't have a tantrum  she just could not get comfy and sleep. Has anyone else been through this around this age?  Any suggestions either on techniques to help her sleep or on how long this might last would be great.  Did anyone bring baby to bed but then manage to kick them out of bed before age 2?  Any help appreciated!""",6
"My daughter is 10 1/2 months old. I have the feeling she is old enough to start disciplining/ignoring unwanted behavior. Do you think she is old enough?
Here is some problematic situations, what do you think about it?
- Our biggest problem is before dinner time. She is hungry, impatient and needy. She whines and screams like a banshee. I keep going to see her, bringing toys or bits of food to make her wait. I feel she understands very well that if she screams and whines, mommy is gonna come with toys and food. Is she old enough to understand that she must wait? If I tell her no"" when she screams she looks at me
 its the screaming banshee again.  we say ""no throwing""  she wants to stand up

"My daughter is 13 months old and can climb over the baby barricades. A few minutes ago I went to the bathroom across the hallway. I left the baby in the living room which is baby safe. Less than 2 minutes and I am washing my hands, suddenly the door to the bathroom opens. It's my daughter. She proceeds to dunk her hands in the toilet while I wonder how she got out of the living room. 
I scrub her up, change her clothes and put her back in the living room to start dinner. My normal routine is to put her in her high chair while I cook. I tell her what I'm doing and she watches me cook from the dining room. Before I can get her high chair out of the living room she is up and over the barricade again. I watched her climb over it masterfully. She goes toward the bathroom so she can play in the toilet but it is latched and she can't get it open yet. 
I quickly make some soup while holding my daughter with the other hand. The whole time thinking Those are my genes coming through right there.""

"My daughter is 15 months old, and has reached a point in her life where she wants to feed herself and won't let us do it (We can if we have to, but it's easier and probably better to let her feed herself).  Are there any good finger food veggies and fruit?  She already has 12 teeth, so chewing isn't a problem for her.  Her pediatrician has things like carrots and grapes on a list of things not to try until 3 presumably because of choking hazards.  
She likes things that aren't slimey or gooey.  We've tried pieces of tomatoes and she's not interested in them.  I'm thinking maybe apple and pear slivers or something along those lines.  Celery would be easy but there really isn't any nutrition in it.

She just had a peanut butter sandwich and then asked for cereal. I told her she could only eat healthy things like fruit and she agreed to eat some fruit. Is it OK for me to let her be possibly bored eating (it may not be that, I just worry that's what it is) even if it's fruit?

I'm an art teacher so she's got everything she could imagine for art projects which she loves. ,6
"My daughter is 4.5 months old and do not intend to start food until 6 months. †I was thinking about starting with meat as her first food. I have two reasons for this thinking: 1) health Canada has recently changed its recommendation to start with iron rich foods such as meat, meat alternatives, or a fortified cereal and 2) my older son hated meat with a passion until over a year because of the texture and taste. I figure maybe if I start with that it will make everything else easier. I'll be making it myself with a nuk food maker. I used mostly jarred food with my son so it will be a new experience. Has anyone started with meats or have any thoughts? †",1
"My daughter is 5 weeks old. For the past week she has been crying a lot and especially while and after I feed her. Burping doesn't make a difference. I'm going crazy, any advice?",6
"My daughter is 6 months old and is healthy happy and we're just starting to introduce solids, she's been breast feed but does take the occasional pumped bottle.
I'm thinking about starting to replace a couple of her daytime feeds with formula- so a few questions..
How necessary is it to sterilise the bottles? Can I just wash them properly- she puts everything in her mouth anyway..
How much do your babies have per feed as an example?
Is there any real difference in the formula brands?
Is there anything else I should know... ",6
"My daughter is 7 1/2 months old and she is a decent sleeper at home. She might cry for a 2-4 min when she does not want to go to bed, but overall, she has her schedule and she falls asleep by her own in her bed.
When she was younger, she could sleep anywhere; car, stroller, on the floor while we eat at friend's house...
Now that she is a bit older, there is NO WAY she will sleep anywhere but in her crib. She is tired, she cries and rub her eyes, but she won't sleep.
We can not leave the house for more than 2 hours.
We can not go to a dinner at a friend's house unless we want to engage in an epic battle to make her sleep in her playpen.
Any tips? 
Do you think she will get better when she is older?
Thank you!",6
"My daughter is 8 1/2 months old. for the last week or two she has shown a lot of interest for finger food. 3 days ago, we decided to try and give her the same supper we were having (noodles, tomatoes and italian sausage). She loved it! We gave her a few more finger food meals and she is really good at eating.
Today, i tried to give her some puree, I still have tons in my freezer. She refused to eat it. She was projectile spitting all over the place, playing with her fingers in her mouth and trying to grab the bits she just spit on her tray. She did the same for lunch and ended up eating half of my sandwich...
So 2 questions:
- What the heck can I do with 2-3 weeks worth of puree in my freezer? Do you have any recipe (maybe some baby muffin with carrot puree or something like that...) I also have 3 full boxes of cereal (oat, wheat and mixed cereals)
- I need finger food menu ideas! veggies and meat are easy, but I'm stuck with cereals... I would like things that I can freeze so I can just put it in the microwave when we are eating something she can't eat.
Thank you!

"My daughter is 8mo old and I think she may be starting to go through some sort of separation axniety. I can usually let her down to play or put her bouncer but lately as soon as i do she freaks out. Yesterday I was trying to make dinner and my husband was with her in the living room and she kept crying, he eneded up following me around the kitchen with her to keep her happy.
I'm super nervous as I'm going back to work in just over a month, I don't know if it will continue, I'm hoping for some advice if any of you have gone through this?",6
"My daughter is 9 mo and has 2 teeth. She's been eating sids for about 2 months now, just little things from whatever is on mine or my husbands plate. I'm wondering if she'll let it get soggy enough to mush up before she swallows it, or just choke? What do other mommas think?",2
"My daughter is 9 months old, and as of late has learned to drink juice out of a sippy cup at meal times. Now I'm having trouble getting her to breastfeed during the day. She used to eat every 2-3 hours and then eat food, she was a very healthy eater at breast and highchair. Now it's like she wants food and juice more than milk. I've even tried pumping milk to put in her sippy cup and she doesn't seem as excited over it as she does her juice. Is this just a phase? I'm really concerned because her weight gain started slipping when we started solid food (20th-25th percentile to the 15th in 3 months). The doctors didn't say anything bad about her weight, because she's grown in height, so we know she's growing. Oh, and if it means anything, she poops and pees fine, there's been no slowing in either. 
**EDIT:** I should of said that the juice is a 50/50 mix juice to water, not straight juice.",6
"My daughter is about to be 8 months old. We have been taking it very slow with solids - we didn't start until she was 6 months old and I have limited it to 1 new food per week because I am hell of paranoid about allergies (major family history). And I was OK with that - she seemed to be picking it up, and really enjoying eating some pureed fruits, which, along with some mashed/pureed veggies, is all she's eaten so far. Well, my day care just informed me that when she turns 8 months (which is in like 12 days), they HAVE to start feeding her at day care. And I am just baffled. I don't know where to go from here. I have been reading everything I can and it's all so vague! I've seen sites that say babies can start holding chunks of solid food at 4 months, and other sites that say babies might"" be ready to grasp and chew food at 9 months. They all warn about choking hazards I have let her ""eat"" (i.e. play with) a banana a few times and that seemed to go pretty well. Can I move on to chunks of other soft food? Tofu? Steamed squash? When is it time for stuff like Cheerios? Does she have to master the squishable stuff first? TL;DR: What the hell do I feed my child? Edit: And how do I know if she's ready for something beyond mushy fruit?""",2
"My daughter is almost 10 months old.  She has 3 teeth and already mastered the pincher grip (I think thats what its called).
For those with older children, how did you manage or deal with the fear of choking? I take precautions, I dont give her food that isn't age appropriate or too big. But she's at the age where if it fits, it ALL goes in her mouth. 
The wife and I are new parents, and I just always have this slight concern and my fear is that because of it I will hinder my daughter's food development. By food development I mean introducing new foods or giving her more age appropriate food items because of that choking fear.
Any words of wisdom?",2
"My daughter is almost 2 and we are finally trying to get her to use sippy cups/straws instead of bottles when she drinks milk.

She doesn't cry or get upsetMy wife and I have packed away the bottles.  My daughter watched us do this and even helped drop a few in the box and seemed perfectly fine with it.  We told her that bottles are for babies and she is a big girl now.The last time she had a bottle or any milk was Monday morning.  She has been eating more food these last couple days but nowhere near enough to make up for the loss of the milk.  Her weight percentile was already low (<10%) so we aren't willing to keep this up past Wednesday.  The Bottle War of 2013 is going nuclear - anyone been in a similar situation or have any advice?""",6
"My daughter is almost a year old and currently does great with finger food and grabbing and eating with a spoon so long as you've already loaded the food on. She's also started occasionally placing food (e.g. half blueberries) on a spoon and trying to eat that but often the food falls off. I've occasionally tried giving her a bowl of yogurt or oatmeal with a spoon, but it always turns pretty quickly into finger play and bowl tipping time. I'm planning on continuing to try this from time to time, but I wonder if there might be a better approach or if it's just too soon.How and when did you introduce/teach your child to eat out of a bowl with a spoon?

Orange juice is her favorite so anything that color/taste will go over best but she does like more or less any fruit juice (what kid doesn't?)",4
"My daughter is finally a year old! Hooray! From birth, she has almost always slept in her own space. Even when we were breast feeding, it seemed like she wanted to sleep in her own space. At 5 months, she was sleeping through the night in her crib by herself. She needed a little encouragement so we used some music and lights. She slept perfectly through the night and would even let me sleep in a little. By 7 months, all I had to do was let her feed herself in her crib and she would be out like a light. Around 8-9 months, we started having issues with her falling asleep in the crib. I'd have to rock her to sleep and place her in her bed. She would wake up 2 times a night. Then she would only take naps in her crib. By 11 months, she was sleeping in my bed full time. I've tried everything I could think of. I would try to transfer her to her own room when she was dead asleep. As soon as I put her down, she was wide awake and screaming. I thought maybe the room scared her. So, I set up her crib in my room hoping to break her of this habit. Still, she refused to sleep in her crib. My friends have agreed that it's probably separation anxiety, but I'm a SAHM so we spend every day together. I figured maybe she would get tired of me sometimes. Haha. I am not a big fan of the cry it out method, but I have tried to let her fall asleep without me picking her up. I went about 15 minutes before I broke down and put her in my bed. When she stays with a sitter or with my parents, she sleeps just fine for them in a crib or pack and play. I don't mind her sleeping with me, but I don't want her to form a bad habit and not be able to sleep by herself. I thought maybe the crib bumpers were pissing her off so I took them off. That didn't work. She plays in her own room just fine though. She will watch a movie or play with her toys and be okay by herself. I'm starting to think that she might benefit from a toddler bed instead. Maybe she doesn't like feeling confined? I'm not sure what else I can try and if I'm doing more harm than good by comforting her in my bed. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I'm hoping some reddit mommies have had this issue before.†",6
"My daughter is just over 10 months old, has 7 or 8 teeth (teething right now and I can't tell if it's one or two coming in). She loves all sorts of food and eats mostly what we eat in blended form. Soups, meats, pastas, beans, fruits, veggies, yogurt, hot cereals... the works. But if I give her food that she can hold and eat the only things she has much interest in are the cereal puffs. I know she can chew but I think self feeding just tasks to long so she prefers me to spoon fed her.
How do I get her to show more interest or is it not too big of a deal right now?",2
"My daughter is nearly 5 months old. She is completely breastfed. I've read that solid food (like single grain rice cereal for babies) should not be introduced until 6 months. I've also heard conflicting stories from other sources. My baby seems to be hungry all the time. She is at the breast at least every 2 hours and she feeds for 45 minutes to an hour. Previously she would go anywhere from 3-5 hours between feedings). It just seems like she is not getting full. In addition to this, she has been showing more interest in food (grabbing it off our plates, leaning towards food, etc). Is it possible she could be ready for solid foods a little early or do we need to just wait this out and hope the constant feeding is a phase? Edit: Wow, thanks everyone for giving such constructive feedback! I realize every baby is different but I just wanted some opinions from other moms with experience and all of you have been great. :) She has an appointment with the pediatrician soon so I will ask him. My husband and I will need to discuss it after we talk to the doctor but we are kind of leaning towards giving her the cereal to see if she is interested. Edit 2:The doctor gave her the go ahead to start solids as long as we follow her cues and allow her to refuse food. We tried the cereal. I let her nurse first and then mixed the cereal with breast milk. Not only did she love the cereal, she kept grabbing the spoon from me and trying to feed herself! I agree she will not get adequate nutrition from solids (most of it ended up on her face or her shirt) so of course I plan to still nurse on demand. I think this was a good introduction to food though. :)",2

She can eat as much as she wants when I get home and does a majority of her tanking up between 2 and 5 in the morning. Should I be worried? Anyone dealt with this?

She wants it, puts it in her mouth, chews it and then doesn't swallow. I have to constantly go into her mouth and scoop the things out. Today I gave her a piece of my tuna and like 30 mins later I saw it in the corner of her cheek. Ugh!Maybe the things I'm giving her aren't big enough for her to break down? If that makes sense. I usually give her things the size of a pea or a little bigger. With the rice I had it mixed in with a pur√©e and she swallowed the pur√©e but didnt swallow the rice. I brought it up at her 9 month appointment and the doctor thought it could be because of her teething. She just got her first two teeth a month ago. I have seen no improvement though. It's fine by me because she nurses great but I just feel like I am not doing the right thing by her because I'm not doing anything about this. Should I be giving her more options? Is there a way to teach her how to swallow? I can't feed her pur√©es forever and I feel like this will just sort itself out but I just want some reassurance. ",2
"My daughter Lizzie is two and a half. Like any child starting out, when she grabs hold of a coloring book, she just fills pages with whatever color ends up in her hand at the time. When we gave her blank paper, she'd draw maybe a line on it, then hand it off to us as a finished masterpiece.
A month ago though, I noticed something different. I had given her sister some paper to draw on, and naturally she wanted some too, so I gave her a small stack. She started tossing out little scribbles, and I almost took no notice, except that I realized she had drawn a circle on the paper. Like a clear, recognizable circle. It seemed significant a difference in her drawing enough that I started looking at the other drawings she was tossing on the floor.
That's when I realized that she was trying to draw people.
http://i.imgur.com/Ln4yk.jpg
This is one of the last drawings she did that day, but it was the most clear example I think that she wasn't just scribbling on the paper anymore. It was almost like with each drawing she gained a better grasp of the fundamentals of a figure drawing... a head, two eyes, a body, legs, some hair...
Since then, she's just exploded with this ability to draw people. I told our daycare about it, and a couple days later she gave me a large paper roll that Lizzie had filled with people.

"My daughter will be 6 in a couple weeks and we already have a check up scheduled for then, so I'll be consulting with her doctor on this.  But I wanted to get a leg up on the situation before I talk to him.
I suspect some kind of food intolerance in my daughter.  She gets frequent diarrhea -from a couple times a week to once a day and she is often gassy.  I have only just started keeping a consistent food diary for her so I don't have anything conclusive from there.  Sometimes it seems as though it happens when she's drinking lots of milk.  Other times she seems fine with milk.  Ditto it happens if she eats too much sweet stuff.  One thing that seems to always result in a diarrhea episode is a pear.  However I know she's also had some of them at times with no problems at all.
Then we have the occasional odd occurrence of her eating something that normally gives her no problems and she spontaneously gets a single hive below her eye.  It lasts for maybe an hour and then resolves on its own. No other symptoms.
I had her tested for food allergies a year ago and they didn't find anything (I know we tested tomatoes, strawberries, nuts, possibly shellfish, but I can't remember the rest).  
So anyway, I'm guessing this may be a food intolerance? Any thoughts?  I have developed lots of food sensitivities myself lately so I'm building up my supply of probiotic foods. Any ideas if this could help my daughter?

However, my husband has decided that milk is unnecessary in her diet. Neither he nor I drink milk, me because I am severely lactose intolerant and him because he just believes milk is meant for cows to feed their young and not for humans. 
I tried to explain to him that the reason we would be switching her to whole milk would be to keep up the healthy fat that babies and toddlers need. He thinks we can find alternative methods to keeping up the healthy fat our baby needs. I feel like that would mean we would have to be constantly feeding her food through out the day (although I don't know for sure, but I assume babies have very high metabolisms).

"My daughter, Ivy, just started at a home daycare 3 weeks ago.  She was 14 weeks old when she started, and has been going mon-wed-fri, but the second week, the daycare provider went on vacation, so Ivy stayed with my mom and my MIL last week.  Today was Ivy's 5th day of actually being in daycare and I got a text message from the daycare mom saying that Ivy is having too hard of a time adjusting, that she cries so much and needs so much attention, that other parents are asking to bring their kids on days that Ivy isn't there because the daycare mom hasn't been able to take them outside, it upsets the other kids, etc.  The text ended with the statement that daycare mom is going to have to ask us to find another provider starting next week!!  
This is totally shocking to me because my daughter is such a chill, happy baby, and I knew that this Monday had been a little rough, but I was hoping that she just needed a little time to get used to everything.  I am totally devastated, feeling like an awful mom, and now have no clue what I am going to do next week!  My husband and I have to work! 
I am pretty upset that the daycare provider is screwing us over like this, but also I feel totally to blame - why can't my kid self soothe yet?  Is it something I am doing wrong?  She does get plenty of attention when I am with her on my days off, but I didn't think I was spoiling her to the point of getting kicked out of daycare!  She spends plenty of time on her own when I am with her, and she doesn't really ever cry unless she is hungry or tired.  I just don't know what to think or do, besides searching frantically for a new daycare!  It's an especially hard week for me at the moment because I think my period might be about to start again - I definitely feel really PMSy and overly emotional, so I basically can't stop crying since I got this stupid text message.  Ivy is EBF, so is it possible that my hormones are making her extra fussy this week? Any advice from the mommies?  

UPDATE!!!!!   
First of all, thank you everyone so much for all the great insight!  It really helped me put everything in perspective to hear everyone's experiences.  I definitely had a bit of an emotional breakdown for most of Wednesday, but still managed to spend the entire afternoon calling every daycare in town.  This amounted to me getting onto a number of waitlists for the better group places and setting up visits for the not-so-great places that had openings.  Also left a ton of voicemails with a number of home daycares (all registered).  
On Thursday we visited a local KinderCare"" center - it was ridiculously depressing.  It was located in a strip-mall Then as we got back in the car and I tried not to cry my phone rang and it was one of the home daycare people - in fact t was AMAZING!!!  It's a family thing - a mother/daughter team with some cousins that help out from time to time.  Apparently the daughter is an artist the mom was a teacher for many years While the old daycare was in the basement of a townhouse this was a huge house with lots of land.  The first thing I saw as we pulled up the driveway was this giant backyard area just completely full of playground equipment and a small group of really happy looking kids!  It was like a magical wonderland!  They have a garden where she grows veggies and uses them in her ORGANIC cooking for the kids!  She says the kids love garden time and they spend pretty much all day outside playing.  She also teaches potty training at 1.5 years  with the one caveat that if you do come you have to play with ALL the kids and not just your own. She says they also do puppet shows and also performance kind of things that parents are encouraged to come see if possible.  I can't believe we found this place and that she actually has an opening!  The daycare mom held Ivy throughout the entire tour In conclusion you guys were all totally right - a complete blessing in disguise!  We found a place that seems to be more awesome than I even dared hope!  I am so excited for my little girl!!  (Also it's kind of fun that we can now tease her that she got kicked out of her first daycare).""",6
"My daughter's biological father stopped helping me pay for rent in March, hasn't contributed to diapers, wipes, or food (the baby is totally breastfed). We broke up a week ago and he decided to move out. 
Should I file for sole custody? Should I file for child support?
Edit: I think I should update with a little more back story to the whole situation.
I'm 23 years old, I have a full-time job that I should be starting in two weeks, he works full-time as well. We had only been together for 4 months before we found out we were pregnant. As soon as that happens we are all good, working together to have an apartment, he'a paying for groceries and taking me to all doctor appointments. She's born, we are still living together, everything is pretty good until he starts going out with his friends and getting wasted and not coming home (this only happened about once a month, so not as bad as it could have been). 
This past August I lost my job, and I switched into being full time stay at home mom. We start fighting, he starts saying that we need to figure out what happens when we break up. 
Our daughter turns one in November. 
Thank you for the replies. I'm feeling pretty wiped out over the whole situation. Breathing and starting to figure out the next steps.",6

"My doctor told me to give a liquid multivitamin to our newborn because apparently strictly breastfed babies are getting scurvy and rickets now The vitamin upsets his digestion and he HATES the taste.

"My fiance and I are reaching the end of our ropes.

Our three year old daughter does not listen, throws tantrums, screams at the top of her lungs, intentionally pees on the floor, her bed, and occasionally me.
We've tried time outs, spankings, taking away toys, reverting back to diapers, and rewarded wanted behavior. None have worked. 
Timeouts: We've put an X in tape on the floor so she knows where her time out spot is. We let her choose between sitting/standing/laying as long as she's on the spot. She gets three minutes. Every time she moves, kicks someone/something, hits someone/something, plays with nearby objects, or spits, the timer is rest.
Spankings: When she hits/kicks she gets a slap on the hand/foot. When she screams, we flick her mouth.
Taking away toys: We take away toys when she throws them, doesn't share, or exceeds warnings. Diapers: When she started peeing on the floor intentionally, we stuck her back in diapers, but she stopped using the potty all together. 
Rewarded behavior: We get very excited when she does something she's supposed to (cleaning up toys, listening to directions) and occasionally let her pick out a treat when we're at the store if she had been good.
 don't think this is about wanting attention. We eat dinner together, I play with her during the day, and we read together at night before bed. Most mornings she'll also cuddle with us before we start the day.
What would the next step be? The only thing I can think of at this point is taking everything away from her.
Edit: I would like to add that anytime she says she needs to use the potty, we let her. We know she's intentionally peeing on stuff because she'll tell us she needs to go potty, then refuses to use it followed by peeing on bed/floor/person.
Edit: Thank you everyone for your input. ",6
"My four year old came home from school today talking about this tea party they had in her class. I'm not really sure how I feel about... Heck, I KNOW how I feel about it, I'm just not sure if I'm overreacting, or if my feelings are justified :-/.
The teacher did not inform me that they were having a tea party today, so I'm currently chalking it up to a toddler's active imagination, but I do plan on asking the teacher about it tomorrow. Anyway, kiddo was telling me how they all sat at the circle table"" and ate chocolate chip biscuits and drank tea in little cups",6
"My four year old is really well behaved in all areas except eating his food.
Here is how breakfast, dinner, etc. often go down:
* Dinner time in 5 minutes!""
* ""Time for food!  Come to the table please!""
* He doesn't come and we have to remind him once or twice more.
* He sits at the table fools around
* His mom and I finish have desert
* We all get up let him be finished
* He is hungry so he gets really cranky.  Depending on how cranky his crankiness may result in him losing his games.
* Eventually he gives in and eats.
A few things we have tried:
* 30 minute timer if it goes off and he hasn't eaten he loses games
 * I don't really like this it creates too much stress
* Give him whatever he didnt eat next time her gets hungry
 * It takes forever for him to get hungry enough to give into his stubbornness
Any other tips?""",1
"My fourteen month old eats amazing some days, and doesn't want to eat other days. For a while he was having oatmeal for breakfast, yogurt and turkey sandwiches for lunch, rice and beans for dinner, and blueberries for a snack. Now he's only really eating pouches. Pouches were great when he was a baby but there isn't enough substance in them and I feel like there's too much sugar.
Any creative ideas? Thanks!",2
"My four-year-old eats very slowly. And not much. Her pediatrician is not too concerned, because he did blood tests and everything is fine, she's healthy, so how much she eats is not as big of an issue as how slow she does it. Each meal could take her a whole hour and sometimes longer. 
I read in various parenting forums that this issue tends to be common at this age, and that maybe I should time her meals and remove the plate after a more normal amount of time, but I fear she'll get even skinnier if I do that. 
Luckily for me she only likes healthy foods, loves her meats, vegetables and eats fruit and dairy. 
Telling her to eat faster doesn't work.  If I really need her to finish up, I have to feed her myself. Watching tv while eating doesn't help. Not watching tv while eating doesn't help either.  Leaving her alone at the table doesn't work.  Talking over dinner won't help. I'm at my wits end.
Suggestions are welcome!",2
"My friend is a single mom of two kids. She is currently attending a graduate program and will be done after Spring semester. As moms, would you rather have kid-centric or you-centric presents? I'm thinking that she would want something practical or consumable. She likes exercise and is very healthy--doesn't really eat sweets or any kind of junk food. She's also into healthy cooking for her kids. I think she uses a cloth diaper service (they clean them for her).

For those of you who have made your own - do you have any tips? How did you figure out what and when to feed your kid? Were you intimidated at first (and what helped ease your concerns)?
For those who didn't - why? Was it a hassle making your own (or did it seem like it would be a hassle)? Were you worried about doing it wrong? Looking back do you think you were overly worried about anything?

My friends just had a baby and when we visit I wanted to bring them a meal (something my mom always tells me to do)..any ideas?  I know a lot of people probably bring lasagna or ham or something?  Was there anything people brought you right after you had a baby that you really enjoyed?  Thanks!,6
"My girl is almost a year old and she has significantly reduced the amount of breastmilk that she drinks daily. She used to have 4-5 bottles of 5 ounces a day. Now she has maybe 4 bottles a day of about 4 ounces. She ranges from 16-20 ounces a day. 
She eats 3 meals almost everyday and eats lots of different things. At daycare she can finish a 4 oz pouch along with a large variety of food. Now I don't know if she eats a lot of it or makes a mess, but when she hangs out with me on the week she can eat an entire pouch in one sitting if she is really hungry. She normally eats an entire stick of cheese, like 1/8th of a cup of greek yogurt, probably 1/4 cup of different fruit. 
Is she getting too much regular food right now and we need to reel it back a little?
She has more solid poops (you know, the easier ones to clean but smell way more interesting lol) but doesn't seem to be uncomfortable when she poops. 
How much milk does/did your 1yr old get and how much regular food?
When can I start giving whole cow's milk?",6
"My husband and I and our one-year-old daughter just moved across the country so that I can start a new job.  Of course, this transition has been unsettling for our daughter.  Although we have done our very best to keep her life as normal as possible (same nap and bedtime routines, new room set up the same way, etc), she has had some difficulty with the changes.  She no longer sleeps through the night.  But most importantly, her separation anxiety has become very extreme, to the point where she cries inconsolably even when she is being left with her father.  Today my husband prepared dinner for her and I had to run out to the store to get a few items.  I used our normal goodbye words, including I'll be back soon.""  She cried hysterically from the second I left until I got back.  I should note that she LOVES her father The most concerning thing is that she will be starting daycare in two weeks.  We have already visited the daycare with her three times and she will be starting very gradually (first an hour Although I think her reaction is perfectly normal I would love any advice on helping her through the next few weeks.  I really can't bear the thought of her crying for hours on end at daycare.  I know that separation anxiety is a developmental milestone",6
"My husband and I are planning on having kids sometime in the future, but I don't want his parents to have any part in our baby's life, other than holiday visits. 
Both of them are horrible disgusting people, and my husband knows it. He moved out at 16 because of how terrible they are. They're never mean to us, but they are incredibly racist, swear worse than I ever have(I swear like a pirate). His father asked if the bruise on our neighbor girl's leg was a hickey. She's 12. 
During on of our visits to his house his neighbor and their kids were over also, and my FIL said 'pussy' more times than I can count. In front of kids. 
And their house... oh god. It doesn't look like my MIL has *ever* washed her stove or vacuumed. The smell in that house is chocking its like rotten food and sewage. 
They also have a mentally disabled adult son who lives with them and they treat him horribly. He gets yelled at constantly, not even just a 'discipline' type yell but full on caps lock rage. I want to call someone and have him removed, but it would most likely put FIL in jail and MIL on the streets since she hasn't had a job in 25 years and they have no savings. 
My husband would be furious if he knew I caused it, and I've got no friends in that town to call for me. 
I don't want them to have any major part in our lives once we have a kid. They don't need to see that kind of stuff even though as a baby they wouldn't remember.
We're going to me moving about 20 hours away to a completely different state hopefully soon, so they wont be able to visit often, but my hubs wants to go back for *every* holiday. I don't know how to tell him that I can't stand them, and don't want them in our child's life.

"My husband and I are struggling with whether or not to feed our first son wheat. We did it one day after having introduced him to rice cereal and oatmeal (for two weeks each). That night, after feeding him wheat, he struggled the entire night. I hardly slept. Since we brought him home from the hospital, he's been a good night sleeper for the most part. In fact, we thought something was wrong with him the first night home because he slept so well.
In any case, after some research, my husband and I are at odds a little about how to proceed. Right now we don't have a pediatrician to give us an opinion (just moved, no insurance to get him a well-check for now). Anyone have any advice? For background, no one in my family has food allergies, and as far as I know, neither does anyone in his family--except his sister's baby. She's allergic to everything. That's most likely coming from her husband.

"My husband and I both grew up in families where eating a meal together at a table was a very rare occurrence, as was going out to eat. We have kept the same lack of formality in our own house (our dining table is just covered in old mail and baby toys) but now that we have an impressionable young toddler, we'd like to start giving her at least the ability to eat a meal at a table even if that's not how we often do things at home. However, since we never did this in our own families, we have no idea what reasonable expectations are by age. She's 16 months now but I'd like to know what's considered usual at 2 and 3 years as well. We would like to take her out with us occasionally and definitely don't want to be *those* parents.
Currently, she will sit and eat at her toddler table for about 5-10 minutes max, alternating between utensils and hands before running off and being very resistant to staying longer--I can't blame her, we've never demonstrated sitting at a table for a whole meal and she eats very little to begin with. She would much rather sit in our laps on the couch and eat *our* food. We feel like this is a bad habit we need to curb soon but haven't done much on that score to date. When we take her to Chipotle or similar now, she hates the highchair but will sit in our laps and mooch happily for a little while but after 20 minutes or so, running around and exploring becomes hard to distract her from and we usually need to leave before she becomes upset at being stuck with us.  In situations she knows the expectations for better, however, she's capable of sitting quietly for much longer periods of time, often up to an hour. 
What were your kids like at mealtimes at around a year and a half? Besides just practicing having meals together at home more often, any tips to help teach her? She's not interested in playing with toys at the table, since once she decides that the new place should be explored, all else pales in comparison.",2

But †I even showed her pictures of fat kids online and healthy weight children and asked her which children she thought she looked most like. She identified with the healthy weight children.

His sleeping is so erratic I don't even know where to begin. For a while he slept from 6am-2pm, but we worked him backwards until he was sleeping from 11:30pm-9am. Now, this past 2 weeks he has been going crazy with his sleeping. He doesn't even seem to have a set time to actually get his long sleep. He just takes a shit ton of naps all throughout the day. It's just so hard to fight him when he wants to sleep. He will also wake up (even if he is just napping) just screaming.

"My husband and I have a beautiful, three month old, baby girl. Before I even got pregnant, we talked about parenting styles and strategies for months, and finally decided that we were ready. Throughout my pregnancy, I felt so excited to be a mom. My husband said he was, too!

But now he's been kind of distant and uninterested in our little girl. Every time he wants to go do something, like get groceries or go to lunch, he wants to drop her off at daycare for it. I understand wanting some grown-up alone time, but its like he doesn't want to spend any time with her. At home, I always ask him to hold her while I make dinner, or whatever, and he never wants to. He just tells me to put her in her crib.

When she got her two-month shots, I felt awful for her. She was fussy and in pain and wanted to be cuddled. My husband, though, said she was just fine and would get over it""! He didn't want to snuggle with her He does help out- When she's hungry at night he gets up with me and changes her before I feed her. And he'll carry her in the Bjorn around the grocery store when I refuse to drop her at daycare. But it's obvious that his help is more so I don't go insane than it is because he wants to take care of her. I've talked to him about it and he says that of course he loves her husband and I know he can be a good loving daddy. It's just taking a lot longer than I expected... How long did your husbands/boyfriends/baby daddies need to adjust? Is there anything I can do to help him bond with her? EDIT: I just want to thank all you mommas for sharing and for your suggestions. It makes me feel a lot more secure to know that he's not the only guy who's a little slow to catch on. We're trying out some suggestions tonight- Right now he's holding her skin-to-skin and reading a little bedtime story. He asked me to leave them alone  and that's okay. I'm not going to keep stressing about it. Thank you!""",6
"My husband and I have been debating this for years now, and I am wondering if anyone else could share their perspective with me.  We were both raised in households where we had to eat everything on our plate no matter what.  I can understand this way of thinking in a different time and place, but it's my opinion that this method in the present day is very flawed.
I think that making a child eat even after they are full can cause a very unhealthy relationship with food over time.  Yes, sometimes my son will tell me he is full even when he is not because he doesn't want to eat it, but then he doesn't get to eat again.  There are times that I catch myself eating long after I have that full"" sensation because it tastes good or I don't want to waste it and I have to catch myself. I don't make anything too out there that my son won't eat but and I give him a little bit of everything to try.  Most of the time he asks for seconds Lately we haven't been scolding him when he doesn't eat what we feel should have been enough for him and for the most part it's been great.  For the initial week he tried to test the limits; he picked at his dinner and then told me at bed time that he was still hungry which made me feel awful..but now its seems that we all enjoy it more.  He knows he won't be in trouble for being full but he also needs to eat with the rest of the family at dinner time",1

"My husband went out of his way for my first Mother's Day last month. Got me a wonderful gift and we had brunch. We spent the day together. For his first Father's Day, I got him a great gift. My dad called me a few days prior asking if I wanted to get together like we usually do. I said yes. I mentioned to my husband that dad and I would have lunch together and we could have some alone time together when baby takes a nap and go out for dinner afterwards.†So lunchtime rolls around and dad and I go out. We end up going to a festival for a few hours. I didn't think it'd be a problem since baby usually naps for a few hours in the afternoon. Meanwhile, I'm getting texts from my husband saying that I'm spending all of the day with my dad and that this must be what being a single father feels like. I hadn't checked my phone until we were done around 3. I thought I'd be able to come back and spend some quality alone time with him while baby naps. No such luck. He's very hurt and upset with me. I try to initiate sex to make it up to him but he isn't the mood (understandable). I ask him what I can do to make it up to him. He said that I shouldn't have to make it up to him and that what I did was wrong. I mention that we can still go out to dinner and try to get some time after baby is asleep. We go out to dinner but end up getting back an hour after baby's bedtime. She is overtired and doesn't want to sleep in the crib. I'm trying my best to soothe her but she cries as soon as I put her down. We're still arguing about the day and I ask him what I should do about baby. Husband comes in and soothes her to sleep on our bed. By this point, it's 9 PM and I'm tired (she's 10 1/2 months and still wakes up a few times to breastfeed and cosleeping is the only thing that's keeping me sane but we're trying to get her to sleep in her crib again). I end up going to sleep with baby. Husband comes in around 1:30 AM, as usual. Today he's barely spoken to me. We normally text throughout the day but I haven't seen anything. I'm so upset about this whole thing. On top of that, I feel lonely. I go to work, come home to tend to baby, clean house and go to sleep. Rinse and repeat. I'm starting to hate where we live. It's a small one bedroom and we just don't have room for anything anymore. He does watch baby during the day but I just feel like it isn't enough. I'm the one that cleans and works. He watches baby, drives/errands and cooks. I don't drive so it's not easy to get around. Most of my friends are busy with their own lives and don't live nearby. I don't have a relationship with my mom due to her mental health issues so it means a lot to me when my dad and I can get together because I finally get out of the house without baby. I guess husband wanted to know why I didn't invite him and baby with to the festival. TBH, I really wanted some alone time with my dad and it was too hot for baby to be out. I'm not really sure where I'm going with this. I want to know if there's something I can do to fix the father's day fiasco with my husband. If there's a way to combat the loneliness too.

I THINK this is what has caused him to start thinking about his mortality, death, etc. When we married he was mid 30s and we had agreed on 2-3 kids and waiting 2 years to start having kids. It was closer to 3 years, we now have a 10 month old. We had said we would try for baby #2 right after a year. I noticed he has been in a mood lately, and yesterday I agreed that if he told me, I would just listen and not respond (that was his request knowing I wouldn't like to hear what he had to say). So he told me he doesn't want another child because he doesn't want to be an old dad, because he doesn't want to be in poor health when the kid is in their 30s, because he would never meet his grandkids- just like his dad never met our son. I listened and asked if we could have a discussion on this next year. Because I'm also not ready for baby #2 right now - I've gotta lose the baby weight or I'll have an at-risk pregnancy. Plus, I had promised just to listen and not discuss. But you guys- I'm heartbroken. We had even agreed that if baby #2 was a boy we would try a 3rd time for a girl. Now, the thought of having an only child makes me so sad! I realize we are blessed to even have this little guy, so please don't think I'm ungrateful. It is just such a change in what I had always envisioned as my family. Any thoughts/comments/suggestions? †Could this just be a mid life crisis thing where his fears of not being around for his kids, change later on? He is in excellent shape & health.",6
"My husband, baby girl and I are going to Vienna for a week. We live in Denmark. We were wondering what to do about formular. She eats Nan 2 Pro, from nestl√©. If we can get this in vienna, will it be the same product, or might it taste different? We are considering just bringing enough for her to eat for the whole week, but that is a lot of milk powder. What would you guys do?",6
"My infant is two weeks old and has been a pretty decent sleeper, with the occasional two a.m. I'm wide awake often he stays up and then he has a shitty night.  Yesterday we were at my aunt's for a few hours and he slept through most of it. Then my SIL and BIL came over for a short visit until 4:30. He was in and out of sleep and had a diaper change and feed. Then it was back to business as usual screaming. This went on until bedtime at 10 at which point he fell asleep only to wake up at 1030  fussing which turned into screaming. We tried letting him fuss for a few minutes but he would just escalate. Eventually when he fell back asleep around midnight he woke up thirty minutes later to eat. We tried everything. Changing him  feeding him gas x  even putting him in the bouncer (which did put him to sleep but when we moved him  he promptly woke up). He spit up a bunch so I assumed he was hungry and even gave up and nursed him to sleep but no dice when he went back in his crib.  Finally my husband rocked him at 1:15 a.m. and little man fell asleep for three hours. I assume at this point kiddo was picking up on my frustration and upset which wasn't helping him but I don't understand why he wouldn't stay asleep when we moved him. Often he was dead to the world when we picked him up. Was he overtired from the day? Should I ignore the ""don't let him sleep longer than three hours in the day"" advice? What can we do next time? I don't know how to cope with the constant screaming and refusal to sleep even though he is clearly tired. Help! (Even as I submit this  he is displaying the same behaviours he did last night... He is stretching and yawning and clearly tired but is fussy and his eyes are wide open.) EDIT: oh my! I meant to type three hour stretches at a time during the day not three hours total during the day. I have been trying to ensure he doesn't sleep for more than three hours at a time but I'm probably going to abandon this as I figure he'll wake when he needs to. """,6
"My in-laws live rather formally. They refuse to baby proof their home and have low glass tables covered in expensive handblown vases; granite marble chess pieces at hands' reach; uncovered outlets; four staircases without gates ... you get the idea. Yesterday, they had a lower oven (less than a foot from the floor) on around 400 degree with a one-year old toddling around. They just don't care about preventing accidents, but will yell and scream at kids (and parents) when they are over. I have a 3-year-old daughter that I have to bring into the situation. 
I'm clearly not going to change them, so I need to figure out how to manage this. Not only is the environment *dangerous* for children (and the only play area an entire floor away), they insist on having family"" dinners that are formal. We're talking full china place settings  it was a disaster.  Every holiday is an unmitigated hell because they REFUSE to accommodate children outside of an occasional sippy cup. Is anyone else in this situation? What would you do? """,6
"My just turned three year old son has started sneaking into our bed at 3-4 am. †He starts out the night in his room and then will come into our room to sleep in the very early morning. †We only have a double bed so space is a little cramped to begin with. †I have tried just taking him back to his room, but then he wakes up fully and I have to get up and get him breakfast very early. †If I just let him sleep in our bed, he will sleep until 7-8. †He goes to bed at 9pm. †Is there any way I can put a stop to this?",6
"My kid is a garbage disposal and I wonder if I'm feeding her too much. We feed her healthy snacks (fruit, cheese, vegetables etc.) and varied food at meals. Breakfast is usually eggs or non-sugar cereal (Cheerios). Lunch is usually turkey lunch meat, carrots, cherry tomatoes and such. And dinner is usually portions of what we're eating (usually a meat a vegetable and a starch).
Anyway, here's the thing. She will eat A LOT if we let her. Sometimes she will eat two bowls of Cheerios a whole apple, and then still want more. She can eat two scrambled eggs and toast and still want more. At most meals she'll just keep eating until we stop feeding her. 
She's in a healthy percentile for weight, but I'm concerned she may be forming poor eating habits, but I don't want to starve the kid because of my neurosis. If she's hungry or growing I want her to eat. 
So do I feed her (healthy food) until she stops eating? Do I portion food, and if so, how much? Any advice will help. Thanks!
Oh yeah, and we don't ever give her juice or sugary snacks. (I'm sure that time will come, but we're avoiding it as long as possible) Sometimes she'll have some string cheese or goldfish crackers, but not often. 
**TLDR I'm pretty sure my two-year-old would eat the entire refrigerator if I let her. How much food is too much?**",2
"My kid is almost 17 months old.  He barely eats anything.  I've read so many places, and had so many people tell me to not worry about it, that a baby won't let itself go hungry.  But he really eats hardly anything at all.  It will take me several sittings to get him to finish a cup of applesauce or yogurt.  It's not that he doesn't like it, either, those are basically the only things I can get him to actually eat.  He likes green beans, but again will only take a few bites before refusing any more.
In my baby books, when it goes over what a kid his age should be eating, I'm *flabbergasted*.  4-5 servings of fruits and vegetables, 4 servings of grains, 2-3 servings of protein, 1 serving of dairy.  PER DAY.  I'm lucky if I get him to eat that much in 5 days.  
He takes milk in a bottle, and water in sippy cups like a champ, but he just isn't big on eating actual food.  
So that is my first question: Should I worry about his eating habits, or does it sound normal for a kid his age?  I've tried to talk to our pediatrician about it, but he brushes it away like it's not a big deal.  I just feel like the guy is not *listening* to what I have to say, like all he's hearing is this toddler is a picky eater"" and telling me not to worry about it. Second problem  and this one is what I'm most concerned about:  He is generally a very happy  very well-behaved little boy.  When he does something wrong He peeled off a part of the padding we have on the fireplace bricks.  I took it away  held it in front of him A little while later  he did it again.  I did the same thing Then he did it a third time  so this time I grabbed his arm (not hard Shaking a finger in his face upsets him  so I only ever do it on a third ""strike"" to emphasize my point.  Usually he just scrunches up his nose and gives a little fuss However  and today is the third time this has ever happened Like I said  this is only the third time it has ever happened I'm wondering if these two things are related?  Maybe he has a stomach problem that keeps him from eating a lot  and makes him more prone to vomit?  I know I should talk to my doctor about it  but as I mentioned Thanks in advance for any advice.""",2
"My kiddo eats like a 16 year old, not a 16 month old. While this is great, he often requests snacks one or two times a day and I'm starting to run out of ideas for healthy snacks. I usually give him some type of canned/boxed infant snack, but even the organic ones still seem unhealthy. 
Any suggestions on healthy snacks? My only limitations are age appropriateness (he can't really chew uncooked stuff like hard veggies) and too much fruit messes up his digestion.
Edit: Thanks for all the suggestions, they have been really helpful. A lot of them I never would have thought about, like the hummus and avocado. I'm trying to avoid too much straight up dairy as well, but there's lots of other stuff to work with from here. If anyone has a particularly good recipe for a healthy snack, please feel free to include it as well. Thanks again!",2
"My kiddo is 9 months old. He was exclusively breastfed until 6 months and we've been introducing solids gradually using the baby-led method. He's a great eater now, loves mealtime and has been gaining weight, so everything is wonderful on that front. The time has finally come where his meals are his primary source of food and breastmilk has become secondary during the day. He still nurses before bed and when he wakes up, and I'm still pumping at work to pad my freezer stash, but he hasn't really been interested in bottles or nursing during the day. I'm not resentful in the least. I'm so proud of his eating and how big and strong and adventurous he is becoming. I know I can nurse him at bedtime and when he wakes up for a good while longer, but this is my first oh my baby is growing up"" moment that I've felt a pang as well as excitement.

"My kids don't care that I'm tired. They really don't. My four year old doesn't care that her 3 week old brother kept me up all night. She only cares about getting her milk the exact moment she rolls out of bed. She doesn't care that I'm still postpartum bleeding. She only cares that the television isn't on and she wants to watch powerpuff girls. My infant son doesn't care if I'm tired, or hot, or on the phone. He only cares that he's hungry and needs to be breastfed this exact moment. My kids don't care if the mortgage is late, the internets getting shut off, and the car's out of gas. They only care about when lunch is. My kids just do not care if mommy and daddy are having a discussion. They don't care if I'm late for an appointment, if I'm having a bad day, if I can't find my left shoe, if my wallet is no where to be found. They care about the fact that they're ready to leave and want to leave NOW. 
My kids just don't care, but I care about them and I know that with time and patience they WILL care. They will be considerate, sweet, compassionate adults and they'll find life partners and get married. They'll then have babies of their own and then they'll know the feeling that I have every single day. 
It's all worth it in the end. I care about my kids even though right now they don't care in the slightest. ",6
"My kids have been going to the same sitter in her home for 2 1/2 years. My son never complained about going to her house, never cried at the door when I was leaving (I barely got a hug goodbye most days) and really enjoyed it. In the last couple months, he has gotten increasingly anxious about going to her house, and will cry every morning when we are heading out the door. He can't seem to verbalize why he doesn't want to go, just that he wants to stay home.  In the last two or three weeks, he has stopped eating at her house. He refuses to eat anything she cooks or gives him.
We have also had him at our back-up babysitter's recently, and he did eat lunch, but had the same anxiety screaming crying tantrum at the door.

"My little booger just turned one, and to be honest, things have been up and down since he was born. †Please don't misunderstand, I love him more than anything. †I'm still not sure if he was colicky in the beginning, or lactose sensitive, but either way, he was a difficult infant. †My own upbringing has conditioned me to not see doctors unless someone is bleeding or dying, and any kind of emotional or mental problem was always something to be ignored until it just 'went away.' So with that small background, my issue is this: †I am finally beginning to suspect that I may have had, and might still have, postpartum depression. †I honestly don't know how long it even lasts, so I could be completely wrong. †I do know that sometimes when my son is being particularly miserable, I imagine myself doing horrible things, like throwing himself across the room, or choking the life out of him. †The worst part is, I don't feel any guilt about it, I just know it's completely screwed up. †I've never actually come close to doing anything like that, thankfully. †I'm beyond ashamed to admit it, but there have been times recently when I've screamed at him at the top of my lungs, pounding on the floor. †There have been times when he's been inconsolable for hours, and I've swatted his butt a little harder than I meant to, or he throws food everywhere at mealtime and I smack his hand rather than tapping it, like I meant to. †Every time this happens I feel horrible, and it breaks my heart, but I feel like I can't stop myself, and I just want to curl into a ball and cry. †This never happened when he was smaller, if I felt frustrated I'd just set him in his crib or swing and just walk away for 10 or 15 minutes, but I would still end up sobbing along with him. †I never mentioned any of this at any appointments because it didn't fit with the 'textbook' definitions I had read about, and I can be stubborn as hell and didn't want to admit there might be something behind it all.

"MY little chick is few months shy of two, and has entered into a seriously picky food phase. She would happily eat mac & cheese (homemade) daily and nightly, for now, and suddenly seems really weirded out by foods that aren't immediately familiar. I say 'for now' because she goes through periods where she loves X or Y then suddenly hates it. Normally, this wouldn't bother me. I manage to get veggies in her, either directly or using stealth, and she likes some fruit. She does over the course of the day usually eat a variety of foods - just not much of any one thing. And I have six younger siblings, so I know just how little a toddler can survive on and still be a healthy ball of crazy energy (which my chick definitely is). BUT my little chick really is little, as in 1st percentile for weight little. She's actually been in the 1st since birth - hello, preemie! - and her weight has followed the growth chart curve, but she's nowhere near a recommended weight for her age/height. My pedi is super low key about it, but he did for the first time ever ask us to come in for a weight check between appointments. So, yeah, I'm a little paranoid about food. About me: I work from home with my little chick, which means crazy busy. And I'm not creative or clever when it comes to recipe ideas or cooking.

18777,Update: It has been only one day and wow. My daughter fought breakfast so I let her down to what she wanted. At lunch it was like having an entirely different baby in front of me! She ate her entire lunch with only a little fussing and I am ecstatic. Thank you all so much, you have no idea how relieved I am. 
18778,I hope this behavior continues and we can move on using utensils. ; )

"My parents had this thick heavy picture frame with a picture of me screaming my head off and wrinkly - fresh out the womb, i assume - and my name is engraved on it and there are inserts that held my baby footprints, a card with my birth weight & size and stuff like that. i'd like to give my pregnant friend something like that before her baby comes but i'm not sure how to search for it. does anyone know what i'm talking about? does it have a name? Thanks!",6
"My partner (she's mommy, I'm mama) has been breastfeeding our 9 month old daughter since birth.  When mommy went back to work, she found pumping logistically hard and unpleasant on top of that, and she eventually couldn't produce enough for the baby's daytime needs, so we began supplementing with formula during the day. We have also started solids, and at this point the baby's diet consists of breast-feeding in the morning, early evening (sometimes), and at bedtime, plus three meals and 1-2 snacks a day that consist of finger foods, pur√©es and/or formula.
Mommy's strategy for keeping up breast-feeding was to set short-term goals for herself (I'll breast-feed for a month, three months, six months and so on) so that she didn't get overwhelmed with the commitment. She has a military training coming up just after our baby turns one year old, and she'll have to be out of town for three weeks continuously with little opportunity for visits from us.  I think she is daunted by the idea of trying to keep up her supply during the entire three weeks. She has said that since she will have accomplished a year of breast-feeding, she'll probably stop at that point. I'm not sure if this is like her smaller goals (ie., once she gets to a year she'll end up wanting to continue for a bit longer) or if she is serious about weaning completely when she goes to her training, so I want to be prepared to support either route.
My questions:
1) have any of you breastfeeding moms tried to keep up your milk supply during a prolonged separation from the baby, and if so how did it go?
2) assuming we do wean the baby completely due to the separation period, would it be better to go cold turkey when mommy leaves, or start the process beforehand either gradually or abruptly while mommy is still around?
3) Mommy is sad at the thought of ending this special bonding time. What are good ways to support her emotionally through that? I was thinking of giving her a little locket with a beautiful photo I took of the baby at the breast, as a sweet way of acknowledging it. Any other thoughts?  
Thanks in advance for your opinions & advice, mommit.",6
"My partner and I are the proud parents of a beautiful fourteen week old baby girl. She is a happy and easy going baby. For about two weeks, we have been doing something similar to controlled crying. This didn't quite register with us until today, because we had a slightly different ideas of what controlled crying is (something closer to crying it out.)
When bubs is with us, she will fight sleep and work herself up, sometimes to the point that she gets overtired and struggles to sleep. She otherwise sleeps incredibly well - generally from 7-8 pm to 8.30 am with one feed in between (around 5am.)
For the past two weeks, we have been putting her down and letting her cry for up to five - ten minutes. This is *only* when she is giving clear tired signs, and only when her cries are grizzly rather than hungry, windy, pained or panicked. So far it has been working well. She is almost always asleep before the five minutes are up. Our only reason for doing this is to help her fall asleep rather than become overtired.
The one time she was still crying at ten minutes because she was way over tired I went in and settled her to sleep because she was past the point she would settle herself.
Is it okay to let a baby cry for up to ten minutes if it helps her fall asleep? ",6
"My ridiculously rambunctious 15mo old has started refusing to eat. She's been a great eater until the last 2 or 3 weeks. She will only eat plain brown rice cakes, bananas and creamed corn. Nothing else! If I try to give her anything else, she will close her eyes tight and hum. I think she's pretending I'm not there!

She used to eat so wonderfully and I'm just worried she's gonna get skinnier. She's already a scrawn, but her Dr said that she's likely going to always be slight"".  Who else went through this?""",2
My sex drive has escalated now that the little guy is 9 months old and I'm feeling more rested. I know I have yet to lose all that pesky baby weight but I think I still look good. My DH is not going for any of my sexual advances. If we have sex once a week it is a miracle and I would enjoy sex much more often. Any one else in this boat or have any advice? ,6
"My sister and a good friend of mine are having twins. I was wanting to get a good list of some life-hacker type ideas to help ease the stress or make things easier for them now (as they're both pregnant) and when the babies are born.  
One idea I got from a nurse who has had twins suggested putting warmed milk in a thermos each night before going to bed to make it so you wouldn't have to warm the milk to feed the babies while trying to get the limited sleep that is hardly available.  Any good ideas would be greatly appreciated!",6

"My sister recently fell on her front teeth and the dentist had to remove most of them, the rest are really fragile and loose.

"My So (we'll call her Sarah) and I are 17 years old and Sarah gave birth about a month ago. She lives with her parents for the time being. Since Sarah gave birth, I have only been able to see her and my daughter 4-5 times. Sarah's parents have been, what it seems like, trying their hardest to prevent me from seeing my child and my SO on a regular basis. I need to be able to see them more of I fear my child will not recognize me as her father in the near future. I want to be an active part of my child's life. I'm not sure what to do or if there even IS anything I can do. I live in Washington State is that helps any. Not sure what else to add. If anyone wants any more info on the situation feel free to ask.
Edit: I have read through every comment on this thread thus far, and I have learned a considerable amount. May seem a little cliche but I would like to thank you all for taking time to respond. I am with my SO right now so I've been pretty busy most of the day. I really need to get on finding a job, I need to put much more effort into it than I have been previously. I'm going to see what I can do about maybe cooking up something and bringing it to their place for dinner sometime soon, and then hoping to have a group discussion of sorts to figure this whole thing out.",6
"My SO and I are disagree on what to do. 
We starting pureed foods at month 6 and gradually increased the amount of solid foods. But did not decrease the frequency of breastfeeding. 
At month 6 our son weighed 15.3 lbs at the pediatrician. Between 6 and 7 months, we felt as if he stopped growing. At month 7 he weighed 15.1 lbs at the pediatrician. Our pediatrician is not concerned. 
Kellymom says growth slows down after month 6 to roughly 1-2 ounces a week and has a section describing how too much solid food may decrease breast milk intake (baby feels full). Ounce for ounce, breast milk has more nutrients than solid/pureed foods. 
He is developing normally and has always been in the 20th-25th percentile. He is now under the 10th percentile. 
Husband wants to limit solid food but mom's intuition says to increase solid food. What would you do? Increase solids or limit? ",2
"My SO and I have been living together for awhile now and his 5 year old daughter stays with us on a bi-weekly schedule.  Everything is great until it comes to meal time. I cook on a regular basis and pack her lunches for school as well. And I'm not making anything crazy or exotic like curry, I'm talking about things like hamburger helper and god-forbid vegetables. And I only give them to her in small amounts. But she flat out refuses to eat anything but mac'n'cheese or cheese pizza. She will sit there for hours playing with her food, pretend to gag constantly,  or play games like I need to go to the bathroom"" every 10 minutes. I've tried threats like ""you'll go to bed hungry""",1
"My SO and I loaded up our two kids, ages 4 and 1 and headed to dinner. We're there and already have our food when an elderly man comes in and is seated across from us. He says hello to the kids and my 4yo daughter chats with him. She talks about her clothes and stuff, says thank you when he compliments her and smiles a lot. And my son wanting in on the attention tells him hi and smiles when he's complimented.
A little time passes and the kids are done eating. The didn't get fussy or loud through the whole meal. The man seems to have gotten up to go to the restroom, but when he comes back he has bought something for the kids as a treat. (The restaurant is Cracker Barrel, which has it's old country store"" attached.)
My SO says ""You didn't have to do that!"" and I thank him. He says ""No no It was so great. I wanted to pay for his meal but the co-manager already had. Talk about instant karma! So I left our waitress a hefty tip
It was a very proud moment for me. I know my kids are usually well behaved but no one has ever complimented them so much",6
"My son (9months) has never been a huge fan of solids. We giving them to him at 5 months but quickly went from pureed to finger foods as he simply refused to open his mouth for certain foods. We now have some success with some items... but it's hardly anything at all! He's still breastfeeding so I know he's getting nutrition. Two months ago, the doctor told us he was a bit underweight for his age. Luckily, this past visit, he'd gained some of it back and is considered normal but still he's only in the 25th percentile for his weight.
He did just pop three teeth out in one go if that makes a difference...",2
"My son and ex live in Florida, while I live in Minnesota. She texts me prior to him arriving to tell me to discuss the importance of school and manners with him (he's 5). We skype almost every night while apart and talk about these things. So am I wrong to just let him AND Me enjoy our holidays together? 
The circumstances of the separation also play a factor, as I feel I was screwed by the judicial decision. Anyway, just curious how others handle the situation? ",6
"My son and I had many troubles breastfeeding, so for the past 4+ months I have been attached to my pump. Today we were playing and I took out my breast to pretend feed him and he latched and actually ate! Very proud moment",6
"My son and I recently spent 20+ hours traveling from Asia to the U.S.  While on the plane the 8 month old behind us began to have a little freak out.  So I reached back and handed mom a bendy zebra toy I had packed for my son.  Little one settled down, played and passed out.  At the end of the flight mom tried to give it back and I told her to keep it for the rest of their flights.
Later that day on a layover in an airport I tried to buy my son a snack.  The mom in front of me bought the last container of apples.  I told my son, Sorry buddy Parenting karma FTW.""",6
My son doesn't want to be put down. Every time we try to set him in his cradle even with toys or the mobile he'll fuss. I would like to be able to do things like cook dinner and workout without a screaming baby. What can I do?,6
"My son had really bad eczema when he was born and had to get him allergy tested a couple months months ago.  He is very allergic to egg, peanut, and a little to dog. Tonight we were out to eat at Olive Garden and just assumed the breadsticks didn't have any egg in them because I had looked it up before.  He ate bits and pieces of the breadstick and by the time dinner was over I noticed his lips were swelling and he had hives on his hand and his eyes were getting red.  We immediately left and got him into the car and were going to call the on call doctor.  All of a sudden he started to projectile vomit.  We immediately used the Epipen on him and he was pissed and cried very loudly which was a good sign to me.  Then he immediately started to act drowsy and sleep, which it was way past his nap time.  My wife was freaking out and was trying to get him to wake up and he didn't seem to respond very well.  He would open his eyes up every once in awhile.  Then after about 10 minutes right before we got to the emergency room, he kind of sat up and seemed to be alert. We spend a couple of hours at the ER and they gave him steroids and whatever else, but he seems to be doing great.  Probably the most scared I have ever been.  Anyone else ever been through this?  Any advice on when you know for sure to give an Epipen and take action?
Edit* I just wanted to thank everyone who posted their story and all of the information I have received.  I've been traveling for work and just logged on and saw all of these responses.  I really appreciate all of the suggestions and it definitely helps me understand food allergies better and how serious it can be.  I definitely didn't take it serious enough at first.  I am going to have my wife read these posts in the morning so she will understand it better.  Now our son is currently sick.  Swollen, sunk in, discharge coming from eyes.  Very bad diarrhea non-stop and wont eat.  She gave him formula before bed and about an hour later I heard death like shrieking coming from upstairs.  Which was her yelling for me to come quick, I thought the worst.  He ended up just throwing up all of his milk, kind of violently though.  I told her she can't scream like that unless someone is dying.  That's a whole different story, but now you can imagine how she was acting on the car ride to the ER when this allergic reaction happened!  Thanks everyone :)",2
"My son hardly eats, I managed to make him eat a banana today. Well I didn't make him his either really picky or just really isn't hungry often. He also wants juice ALL the time, I am watering it down and when I really want him to slow down I just give him water because he chugs anything else. If I don't get him drink he constantly pushes a cup in my hand and gets really annoyed. I am just concerned about the amount his eating. Some days he eats next to nothing but other days he eats everything in front of him. ",2
"My son has a very limited variety when it comes to food. He doesn't like meat of any kind in anyway. He also doesn't like anything that has a savory or salty taste to it. I'm worried about this because I feel like he should be eating more and different kinds of foods by now. At his 12 month appointment, the doctor said he could eat anything we ate, but he just doesn't like anything. Here is our usual routine-Mornings he will have oatmeal or yogurt with Cheerios or a cereal bar. Snacks are fruit or animal crackers. Nap he gets whole milk Lunch he will eat veggies or fruits and dinner I give him veggies. Bed time he gets more whole milk. I want to give him different things other than just fruits and veggies, but I'm lost. If anyone could give me examples of what their kids around the same age eat or used to eat (if they're older now) that would be really helpful.†",2
"My son has always been a happy baby, never really fussed, never cried too much, always a good eater and sleeper. Now, at thirteen months its like all hell has broken loose. I feel like my parenting is terrible or something. He wakes up grumpy, screams at me until I feed him, throws his toys at me, throws himself on the floor, scratches if I try to put him down, its horrible. And so stressful.

"My son has been in daycare since he was five months old, and he turned two in July. Right after Labor Day, he moved up from the class with the one-to-two-year-olds to the class with the two-three-year-olds (the one just before the preschool class). A few weeks before that, we moved from the apartment where he has always lived to a new house, so we expected this to be a challenging time for him, and we talked to him a lot about the things that would be changing (new house! new room! new teachers! same family! same friends!

He loves to read and is a happy kid but in school he can't behave. He talks out of turn, all the time, likes to argue with the teacher and gets very frustrated very easily.

"My son has had chronic diarrhea for months. We recently took him to a GI specialist to figure out whats going on and after quite a bit of testing the answer came back as a severe dairy allergy. We have an appointment with his pediatrician, a nutritionist and an allergist but I'm hoping for some insight from other parents in the meantime. Most specifically, does anyone have any resources for kids with food allergies. Maybe a website with a list of foods to stay away from or dairy free recipes?

I'm gonna make him some special chocolates and put them in his bag so he can have some of that at least.

"My son has steadily dropped from 50th to 11th percentile since ~4 months.

Until about 10 mo, he ate everything and anything we sent for him at daycare but now he outright refuses a lot of foods, sometimes entire meals. Used to like but now takes only a couple bites or less: Yogurt, bread, oatmeal, sweet potato, avocado hates: potatoes likes: green beans, tomatoes, cheese, fruit, olives Our doctor wants us to give him pediasure or carnation instant breakfast and focus on high calorie foods. He will tolerate a little pediasure (I mix it with breastmilk) but drinks a lot less from his sippy now that it's not 100% breastmilk in his cup. Meal times have become stressful and intense.

My son is 1 Month old and eating every 2 hours about 2 oz. How long did your baby go without eating at a month old?

I woke up exactly an hour later and looked at time and realized my baby had made it 3 hours without eating!!!! Woohoo! He seemed fine. He was fast asleep. Out of guilt I woke him up and fed him.

My son is 11 months old and does really well with solid foods but for some reason he won't put food in his mouth. We've tried everything we could think of to get him to feed himself he just won't do it.  When we give him snacks he will only eat it if it comes from our hands. If we put it in his hands he just plays with it and tosses it around. He will however put non food items in his mouth no issue at all.Any advice/tips would be appreciated.,1
"My son is 11 months old and pretty much since he started daycare at 3 months our evenings go something like this: 
* pick him up from daycare around 5:30
* get dinner going (or pick something up), eat around 6:30
* he's usually hungry and/or tired as soon as we get him, so we often give him a snack while we cook if dinner is not immediately ready
* he'll usually tire toward the end of dinner and go to bed between 7 and 8
I assume this is typical (though I'd love to know if not) so my question is: how do other working parents make the most of their short evenings with their kids?

"My son is 11 months old today! He is getting pretty good at eating, and now we give him a pretty wide variety of things to try. Now that lunches/dinners are pretty consistent, I'd like to start planning our meals for each week, so I don't have to come up with an idea of what to fix each time lunch or dinner approaches, when time -- and sometimes creativity -- is short.
How do you all handle this? Do you use any menu planning tools?
Right now I get a lot of inspiration from Weelicious and WholesomeBabyFood. But I'd like to start organizing things a little more and have a system. I think that way we can also be sure that he eats a good variety of foods and a balanced diet.
We buy local/organic as much as possible, and we eat out maybe a few times a week, so we'd want our system to be able to accommodate those things. Also, we'd like to form another babby in 2012, so down the line the system will ideally need to handle the needs of an infant and a toddler and two adults. Thanks, Reddit moms and dads!",2

"My son is 13 months and,so far, has eaten pretty much everything. He recently started refusing everything we try to feed him by spoon, which is ok because he feeds himself just fine. In the past he has eaten pretty much any type of veggie, pureed or as finger food. 3 days ago his tasted seemed to change over night. He will not ingest any type of veggie, period. He'll put it in his mouth, make a yucky face, and spit it out and throw it on the floor.  He has been eating everything else fine. Loves fruits, meat, cheese, bread, pasta and has been eating them like normal. What gives with the veggies?
I know its normal for kids taste to change, but this drastically and this quickly? I'm used to hiding veggies in some food(like pasta sauce) as my husband isn't a big fan but I'm still bummed hes totally rejecting them. I was pretty spoiled with a baby who ate everything.

"My son is 14 months. He's doing GREAT with a sippy cup. He still eats from the tray on his high chair. I tried putting his food on a plate last week, it ended up all in his lap. Any advice on when/how to start introducing plates and spoons? He's still throwing the sippy cup when he's finished drinking about 25% of the time, which is still progress because he used to throw it to the floor after each drink. Now, he's learning to sit it on his high chair and leave it there until he's ready for another drink.†",2
"My son is 16 months and his pediatrician advised us to wean him off formula. At the moment he's having three bottles a day. My problem is that I don't think he is getting enough nutrition in the solids that he's eating. He will only eat things that taste sweet like yogurt, apple sauce or little cups of fruit. I've tried just about every vegetable I can think of but even while he's hungry he will spit it into his hand and throw it. We've also tried rice, eggs, oatmeal, toast and spaghetti. He may take one or two bites and actually swallow it but for the most part he's only really eating the sweet stuff. 
I worry that he isn't getting enough nutrition on such a limited diet and I'm afraid to completely wean him off the bottle because of it. 
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",2
"My son is 17 months old (14 corrected) and he has been SUPER clingy on me for the last month or so. If he can see me but not have access to me he freaks out and cries. Not even his daddy can calm him down when he's in his mommy mood, which is pretty much all the time. 
I especially feel bad for my husband. He wants cuddles and kisses and to just hold him sometimes, but he arches his back and cries to get away and back to me. I'm a SAHM and my husband works a lot, so I'm sure  that's a big part of it. Any suggestions for helping them bond? I've thought about trying daddy-son time and leaving them alone for a few hours on the weekends. If I'm not around, he's usually okay. 
Tell me this is normal and it will pass soon. I love holding him and cuddling, but I'd like to be able to make dinner without a crying kid. ",6
"My son is 18 months and I love being his mom.
But until recently, I really hated being a parent. I had a healthy birth and pregnancy. But a year of nursing every 2 hours around the clock, the colicky period which lasted until 10 months old, the dairy/soy/unidentified food sensitivities that made him very unhappy and put blood in his stool (no doctors could do anything about it), never getting to put him down unless I wanted to hear him scream (he hated swings, bouncy seats, etc)...
I was *so sure* that I didn't want any more kids after that hellish experience. My regular issues with anxiety skyrocketed and I had terrible post partum depression. 
But now that therapy, time, herbs, and self-improvement have put my anxiety and depression under better control than ever in my life, and I've learned to relax into parenthood and stop fighting for what I thought it would be like... I want another. 
Am I crazy? I'm thinking I want my son to be 3 or 4 before I have another, just in case the next one is colicky too, and to give me more time to mentally prepare. 
But I'm wondering what your experiences were, as parents who were traumatized by a bad experience the first time around... basically, what I want to hear is that while it may not be easy to take care of multiple kids, it's easier to be a parent the second time around now that you know all you know.  What I don't want to hear is that it's just as terrible to do it twice, haha. ",6

"My son is 3 months old. We got off to a bad start with breastfeeding and I'm wondering if this will ever get better.
In the hospital I was breastfeeding him for the 5 days we were there, but my milk wasn't coming in yet and he was losing too much weight so they insisted on supplementing with formula. When we got home from the hospital I tried to breastfeed exclusively, and only brought out the formula when he seemed particularly upset or tired. So maybe 2-3 times a day.

Then we had a two week check up with the nurse midwife, at which point I was told that my son was not gaining enough weight and that I needed to give him formula at every feeding. So 8-10 times a day, breastfeed for as long as he wants and then formula, in increasing amounts. She had me really scared that I was starving or abusing him, so I went home intending to do exactly as she said.
Well it didn't take my baby long to figure out that he didn't need to do the hard work of breastfeeding because a bottle would be coming soon after, and that if he just refused to breastfeed that bottle would come sooner. Pretty soon he was hardly breastfeeding at all. I started getting desperate. I read everything I could find about breastfeeding, bought every product that promised to help.
I'm living in my husband's country now, and I can't find anything like a lactation consultant here. The midwives at my hospital do consulting, but their advice was basically let him cry it out, don't give him the bottle when he cries, just comfort him and keep offering the breast, then continue with supplementing after each feeding. (They did rule out any physical problems for either of us.) This works some of the time but I really don't like it. A few times when I've been out with no spare formula or ran out at home I've seen that he will eventually take the breast, no matter how much he cries, if formula never makes an appearance. But I feel terrible about doing this to him.
My pediatrician says that even a little breastmilk is better than none, and that since he's growing well, I should just stop stressing about it and keep doing what we're doing. But it's really stressful to go through this cycle of getting him to breastfeed willingly, then him deciding he'd rather have a bottle and spending less and less time breastfeeding, then getting him used to breastfeeding again.
I've read advice from La Leche League and others that say to stop using bottles entirely, but this seems harsh. He still needs to eat somehow. I've been pumping to keep my supply up, but I can only get about an ounce per session so it's not enough if he's refusing to breastfeed.
What I'm wondering is, will this get any better? Is there anything I can do to make this less stressful for both of us? Is it worth it to keep stressing out my son when he clearly would be happy drinking only formula?
I feel like I don't have any support here; my family is far away, my husband's family isn't very helpful, and my husband doesn't understand why I still want to breastfeed our son when it's going so badly.",6
"My son is 3 years 3 months old and last weekend we decided to try to start potty training. †We went the weekend with a naked little guy and tried to fill him with liquids and food to keep the system moving. †He did ok. †He wasn't resistant but I wouldn't say he was completely on board either. † Of course the moment we put underpants on he did not hesitate to pee on them. †We also made a big deal each time he successfully went and gave him cookie or candy etc to try to keep it exciting or enticing at least. †I am a stay home mom, so after the weekend. †I have continued keeping him bottom naked and us close to home the last two days and again with mixed success. †Sometimes he goes to the potty no problem and other times just goes where he is. †I have been talking to him and reminding him as he plays. †I have been putting him on the potty consistently to keep trying.

Here's the kicker... my son is severely delayed in his speech. †He understands us perfectly, follows direction fairly well (this IS a 2 Ω year old we're talking about), so there's no question on comprehension or intelligence. †But when it comes to him communicating with us, he prefers to use his own little language. †We call it booginese"". †He's getting better. †I'm hungry for breakfast could I have my oatmeal please?"" comes out as ""Hots pweese.""). †And when I ask clarifying questions every answer is ""yeah"" or ""yes""... so when he says ""Hots pweese"" I could answer with ""You'd like fried stegasaurs leg with cream cheese and gooseberry jam?"" and he'd say ""yeah.""

He's in daycare 3 days a week half days he started asking for diaper changes shortly after he started in daycare.

"My son is 4 months and the doctor just suggested putting cereal in his bottles a couple times a day. Just curious, if it is okay to introduce in his bottles, is it okay to spoon feed the cereal?

What has worked for you?†",2
"My son is 6 months old. Two weeks ago, my wife finally relented and made the transition having the baby sleep in the pack-and-play beside the bed to his crib in his own room.  
The first week went better than we ever could have expected. After a little wind down play time and a bath, he would take his last bottle around 8pm and then he would sleep until 530 or 6am. We thought we had it nailed.  
Then last week, he woke up, wide awake at 4am. Not unhappy, just wide awake. We would give him a bottle and he may or may not fall back asleep before we need to get up and start getting ready for work.  
My wife had read that sleep promotes sleep, that maybe he wasn't getting enough (not sold on the idea, but whatever). So we started taking him up for his bath and play time a little earlier, putting him down around 740 each night. Still wakes up at 4am.  
His post-bath bottle is only 4oz, sometimes it's just a struggle to get him to take more than that because he falls asleep. He used to take 6oz. We hesitate to try to keep him awake past 8pm because he gets pretty fussy and we're afraid he'll just work himself up to the point where he won't eat.  
I guess what I'm asking is, should we try to force him to eat more? Should we start earlier so he isn't so tired? What else can we try to help him sleep a little longer? Thanks, y'all. ",6
"My son is 8 months old next week, and lately he has been resisting being put down to sleep more and more.  We only try to put him down when he is yawning, rubbing his eyes, or beginning to get very fussy.  Often he shows he is tired by trying to stand, but not being able to hold himself up very long.  
We have been putting him in his swing, feeding him a bottle, and he usually falls asleep like a champ, but now when he gets tired he swats at the bottle, yells when he is being held, yells when he is in the swing, and pretty much just yells.  We have tried just letting him be in the swing until he goes to sleep, but he just ends up screaming a ton.
Any advice?
-- EDIT --
So I got the book, and it has been helpful in us trying to catch him up on his sleep. When it comes to crying extinction, I'm sure everyone goes through the same gut wrenching...
So when we put him down for sleep at night, lately he has been fussy and I guess wanting to play, we usually feed him but we can't since he is kicking and squirming. I just let him cry for like 45 minutes, is that the right thing to do? According to the book I should put him down sleepy, which he def. was not. So should I go in after a bit soothe him, feed him then let him sleep? He can sleep doing that no problem.

"My son is 8 months old, so when I say older babies I generally mean pretty active and at least semi-mobile(i.e. you can't really just stick them in a bouncy seat or carrier for long periods anymore). My husband and I both work 9-5 jobs, so usually at the end of the day he'll watch the baby while I make dinner. But sometimes he works late, and I'd like to get dinner started at the usual time, but I really don't know how to accomplish this. Our kitchen is really closed off from the rest of the house, so I can't keep an eye on him if he's playing in another room. He's not quite crawling yet but he rolls and scoots enough to get into trouble if we're not nearby. The kitchen is also really cramped, so there's not really any place to put him on the floor in there. I can put him in an exersaucer in the kitchen, but he'll get bored with that before long. Same with a high chair - I can give him some puffs to munch on but again this only holds interest for so long before he screams to get down. Keeping him restrained in something for the entire 30-45 minutes it would take me to cook just doesn't seem possible. I imagine this is just going to get more difficult as he gets more mobile. But I figure there are plenty of moms who somehow manage to cook dinner while watching the baby...so I've come here to ask: How?!",6
"My son is 8 years old. He is very intelligent and does well in school academically, but behaviorally has had increasing problems. He's in third grade. His problems at school range from talking, to bullying other kids (only smaller than him), to violence. His father and I were 19 when we had him, got married, but only stayed together until he was 2. I had good job for the small town where we're living, but lost it when the account I worked for was pulled. I met my girlfriend (I'm a girl) at this time, my son was three. After scraping by at minimum wage or little better, her mother invited us to stay with her so that we could enroll in college and afford food and things. We've got 3 semesters left before we'll graduate as RNs. My son does okay at our house, nothing unusual about his behavior, but at his dad's (modified standard visitations) he's a different kid. He screams at them, uses profanity, sexually inappropriate gestures, and last Monday, he got mad at his dad for telling him not to jump on the furniture, so he walked accross the room, picked up an ~ 4 month old kitten and threw it at the front door. According to his dad, it made a load thump, cried out, and then ran and hid. It isn't injured, thank god. My son said at first he didn't feel bad, but he went to his room and started worrying about the kitten.
I am going to make an appointment with a professional, but I'm worried this is my fault for being so broke, on KTAP, living with girlfriend's mom, ect.

"My son is a little over 6 months old, started solids a couple weeks before he turned 6mo per doctors instruction. In some of the baby food recipe books I have, it says coughing is a sign of an allergy. He started coughing more than normal a few days after starting his oatmeal. So I switched to rice cereal, and he still coughed. Nothing immediate after eating, but through out the day he has little wheezing fits and coughs.
I took him to his 6mo well check and asked the doctor if his lungs and breathing sounded okay and she said it was fine, so I dismissed the coughing as me being paranoid but after switching back to oatmeal and some other veggies and fruit he still coughs and it's getting worse. I'm gonna stick with oatmeal for not because rice cereal plugs him up and I don't think he's allergic to it but I'm a little concerned today because he's coughing so hard he's been spitting up. It's not an alarming amount but he almost never spits up and this isn't even after he eats. It can be an hour after and he coughs and spits up. 
Has anyone else had their LO get a little cough after starting solids? Should I go back and make the doctor listen again? I go to a clinic (not judging anyone who also goes, or works at one) but I feel like because he is pretty damn healthy every other way, they just dismiss my concerns because they're so busy so I almost want to go get a second opinion but I don't want to look crazy when he's totally fine.

"My son is steadily nearing the 9 months mark and we recently started having to put him in daycare a few days a week. Previously, my mother-in-law provided the majority of the care for him during the work day, and it was amazing! When looking for a childcare provider I tried to be realistic in that I am sure that he wouldn't be able to receive the same extensive care given to him in the one-on-one environment a family member could give him. I went in knowing that, and I was ok with that. I looked for a long time for a place that would best fit our needs and that had a wonderful location. After a month it has become apparent that what we expect and what is provided aren't exact the same, and I am trying to figure out if I am just expecting too much. My issues: Often when I pick him up he has dirty clothes even though I provided plenty of outfit changes. They don't follow the feeding schedule we posted for him. They often over feed him which causes him to spit up food (which causes the dirty clothes) He is constantly being sent home with incidents reports where he has fallen or crawled into things. They showed us the videos and he is really doing these things, but I feel that they aren't paying enough attention to him. Sometimes, because he is so active and mobile, they put him in a room with the bigger kids ( older toddlers) who often crawl over him and steal his toys. We were asked to bring blankets and toys but I consistently finds the toys (with his name on them) in the communal toy box or in the cubbies of other children. They often lose his toys and blankets. I expect some of this to a degree but it seems to be getting ridiculous. The girls in the room are replacements for the teachers that were there when we first signed up ( one left without notice, the other went on maternity leave). I find them often talking very loudly about their personal lives when I pick him up, and I seem to have to beg them to tell me about how he was today. No one seems to know when he last eat, or I find they fed him much later than necessary. His nose always seems to be crusty. I am talking about it being ridiculously. So much that he has trouble really breathing. Can no one find the time to wipe it? He hates the swing but they consistently put him in it even when he cries to no end about it. I have asked them no to do that. We don't own one so he doesn't have to be in it. They will run out of supplies and won't tell me about it ( I check, but sometimes I will miss something). They are suppose to write it on his daily sheet, but never do. Then I get a call from an angry teacher about how he doesn't have something he should. I think, †Well Sometimes they would ""accidentally"" feed him someone else's food and I understand that happens but he has strawberry allergy that really causes him problems. It hasn't happened yet †but what if they feed him something with strawberries in it? I bring in labeled and specific food that doesn't have strawberry in it for a reason. I just wish they would communicate with me because I try so hard to communicate with them. I talked to the director at the school (after talking to them with no improvement) and she promised to address it but it seems as though the teachers resent me now. It seems like such a popular daycare and all the kids seems happy. I want to like this placeI know I could find another place. I know if I am unhappy I should. And I plan on it I would love to hear from experienced moms and experience daycare professional on what I should realistically expect.†Edit: Thanks for the advice everyone! It was amazing †all of it.

"My son is three months old. We cosleep and it has worked well for us. He would go to bed when we did and fall right asleep next to me. Recently he had become very figgity.

Last night was the worst it has been. I could not get him to settle until I was propped up and he was sleeping on my chest. This morning, he is obviously exhausted. However, he starts immediately into a desperate squeaky cry the second I set him down to pee or get dressed. A couple times he has whimpered in my arms. Does anyone have any ideas what is going on?

"My son is three years old now and for about a year straight he has been saying silly little things like I like farts, imma eat poo poo, I fart out of my stinky butt, and his favorite poopy diaper. It was really cute and innocent at first but it seems to be all he talks about now. Last time we went groceries shopping he stopped a woman and told her he wanted to smell her stinky farts........ Its fucking hilarious.. When it's not your kid but I was horrified. That was the last straw. I had to threaten him the rest of the time in the store that if he didn't stop he wouldn't get his surprise. I'm at a loss. Help me reddit.",6
"My son is two weeks old, and my pediatrician is on vacation until Monday. We had a weight check today with his NP, and she asked us what we discussed with the pediatrician about my sons CF screen. Um wtf?? She said that my sons newborn screen had an 'abnormal' CF result- she stressed it wasn't positive, just not negative? And that 'if it was anything important you would have been called'. As it is, she put in a message for him to call us first thing Monday morning to discuss with us.... But I don't know how not to panic in the meantime. Has anyone had anything like this?",6
"My son is working on potty training but recently he has been saying owie owie my butt hurts. We have looked no irritation or visible issues. He eats tons of fruit and a good balanced diet.

We are expecting baby number two soon and I wonder if its something subconscious about his new baby brother.†",6
"My son just turned 1 last week and we had to take him off formula and switch to whole milk, he was never a big eater"" it was just mostly formula and cereal. Since switching I've tried to introduce ""food"" sometimes he gags(the gags turn into projectile puke) on it other times he doesn't (same food different results) he doesn't want the Milk and I think he's hungry because he's cranky (he never been a cranky baby).

"My son just turned 11 months old yesterday. And we have a HUGE problem with his eating habits. He wants his food. He wants it NOW and he wants it all. If I'm too slow on a bite or on handing him some finger food he has a meltdown. He gets bright red and just starts wailing. I dread meal times. And even between bites, even if he's feeding himself, he whines. Every time he eats it's this huge ordeal. I don't know what to do. Do any of you have any helpful tips? Thanks!",2

"My son just turned 2 in September. As he's gotten older we've found that his energy levels have rapidly increased (read: he steals all of our energy). He's in daycare full time during the week from around 7 am to around 4:30-5:30 pm depending when I can get off work. All this only started happening over the last two weeks. 
45569,He's always been a bit of a handful when it comes to naps and bedtime because he just fights sleeping so incredibly hard. Usually a bottle, his favorite blanket and a bit of cuddles quietly in his room will do the trick, but lately not so much. We try our best to have him at minimum in his room by 8pm. Usually we try for earlier but that doesn't always work with dinner and whatnot. But lately it doesn't seem to matter what we do. We take him to bed and put him down for 8pm and have to go back in 2 or 3 times, sometimes more to settle him down after putting him to bed. It's to the point now that he stays up playing (quite vigorously) in his bed until 10pm or later. With him getting up anywhere between 5:30-6:30 in the morning he is definitely not getting enough sleep through the night. Even daycare is starting to notice that he won't settle down for naps, and won't even settle down for any form of quiet time. We are doing our best to keep  him active the entire time he's awake, taking him outside and running around with him. Doing different activities and baths (which also used to be a monumental issue). Nothing we do seems to be able to allow him to expel enough energy to let him settle. 
45570,
45571,He still sleeps in a crib, predominately right now because I'm afraid of changing him over to a regular kind of bed because as much as he can get out of the crib now he stays in it. But he'll jump on the mattress and kick the walls and open his dresser drawers and dump stuff out. Does anything and everything he can to keep himself awake. 
45572,My boyfriend and I are at a loss on what to do to help him get some more sleep. Unfortunately we know that he is utterly exhausted, but he just won't give up the fight.

"My son of 2 and a half weeks eats like he's never had food before in his life. We feed him Enfamil the purple one for fussyness because he had a hard time digesting the regular formula, 2 oz every two to four hours depending on his sleep cycle. Now, he's not always like this durring feeding time. He crys, wiggles around pushing the bottle out of his mouth with his hands from flailing around, choking from how fast he's trying to eat, projectile vomiting from eating too fast. I know babies are supposed to do three to four sucks rest and repeat but when he's like this he doesn't have a resting point. Sometimes.. sometimes he eats calmly and it's great, he rests and burps like he should. Other times it's like this. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong or if this is a normal thing to have happen? It just doesn't seem right to have him crying while I'm trying to feed him.",6
"My son started Preschool 6 six weeks ago, and a couple of weeks in he started having trouble. He wasn't making the transitions from one activity to another, then one day I get a call saying I needed to come by and help because he was crying non stop and not eating his lunch. When I got there, the teacher had a blanket on the floor in an attempt to get him to eat picnic style"". I'm thinking †he'll learn his lesson. So I hung out the rest of the class and I see my son is not listening to the teacher AT ALL. The next class I get a call maybe a half an hour later saying he's crying and asking for me and I need to come by. At the end of the day †the teacher tells me he has separation anxiety and I have to be there each class.†Now it's been a month and my son is not at all participating. He doesn't listen to me †or his teacher. Now his behavior at home is getting worse †and I'm kind of lost myself. He is a tenacious little fella. Has anyone had an experience like this? I'm worried his increasingly aggressive behavior will get worse †or I will have problems in daycare. I start back at work full time next week and will not be able to come and rescue the teacher when she gets frustrated with him.†EDIT: Thank you for the comments. I think I'm going to go with my instincts and transfer him to a regular preschool rather then the co-op. I don't think he is comfortable there.

"My son used to eat EVERYTHING. He loved food.  Then out of the blue, around 17 mos, he started REFUSING everything. Even foods that were his favorites.  I know he's testing me because he 1) won't even try the food before deciding not to eat it and 2) will eat the entire plate, assuming I can finally convince him to try it.

I have tried:
*Cutting back/limiting/eliminating snacks before meals
*Not making separate meals and just keep offering the same one until he at least tries it (he's even gone to bed hungry once).
*Making him sit in his char until he decides to start eating or tell me he's all done"" *My husband and/or I eat every meal with him (and the same things) to set a good example.

"My son was a difficult baby. I say difficult instead of challenging because he wasn't premature, but we did spend 3 days in the NICU for jaundice. He did eat and gain weight, but breastfeeding was a disaster. We did get SOME sleep, but it was always on or near me or my husband. He wasn't in and out of the hospital, but we did have pneumonia at just over a year and still struggle with asthma today. †However, he's almost three and I feel like I've finally hit the surface and am getting those first few gulps of air. †The first year of parenthood was almost disaster for my marriage. †My husband completely withdrew and I felt abandoned and alone far away from family (we're military). †Then I found a job. †Then we moved and I found my dream job. Now, he's talking, interacting, cracking jokes, playing on the splash pad while I read and most importantly... SLEEPING! †I can count on a night of rest and a glass of wine and at least one whole hour of Netflix to myself. †This was a part of the tunnel I truly had not known existed. I say part because I also know now that difficulty comes and goes. So for those of you still in the dark, there is light. For those of us in the light, soak it in.

My son was in the process of starting to feed himself - he would grab food from his bowl or plate. A month ago he stopped doing this. If we don't feed him he will just sit there and cry. He is also doing this at day care and I worry that he is going without food as the teachers may not have time to feed him (ratio of 1 to 7). We have been trying to encourage him to grab food and celebrate every bit he takes on his own but this does not seem to help. Any advice would be appreciated.,3
my son who turns one next month eats more than any other baby i have ever seen. He eats like a full grown adult and he gets super cranky if he hasnt been fed in like an hour. IM not sure this is normal he used to eat a bit more than usual but now its gettin insane . He is only a year and he weighs 22 lbs so hes not a very fat baby infact when he stands up u can see his ribs. 80 percent of his time awake is spent eating and even when we feed him then we eat something ourselves he watches us eat like he hasnt been fed in a week. My gfs grandma said that both my gf and gfs dad ate alot when they were infants but im just curious if anyone elses little ones eat like him?,2
"My son will be 1 in October and is still EBF.  I started attempting to feed him solids when he was about 5 months old, and he hated them from the get go. ([This picture](http://i.imgur.com/K5DJdJR.jpg) was his first adventure with puree, and it's the same reaction he's had to it every time).  With purees he'll just make a terrible face, spit most of it out, and make a few retching noises if it's something he particularly hates.  For more solid types of foods, he might pick them up and stick them in his mouth for a second, but then he'll spit them right back out.  If it manages to get towards the back of his mouth he will start coughing and making gagging noises, as if he doesn't know how to swallow it properly, maybe?  Or maybe he doesn't like the feeling of having something near his throat?  I've tried all sorts of foods, from every manner of puree, baby finger snack foods, and pieces of just about everything I eat.  He doesn't like any of it.  The only thing he'll eat with any enthusiasm is ice cream, but I don't let him have that often.  
I don't mind breastfeeding him for the most part (although he's gotten a lot of new teeth lately and it's starting to hurt...), but I'm worried that he's not getting enough nutrients.  His weight/height are in healthy ranges, he's hitting milestones in a timely manner, from what I can tell there's nothing wrong with him thus far.  But I'd like to get him eating food sooner than later before it does become a problem.",2

"My son will be 2 next friday, (yay) but he is driving me crazy. He is constantly pushing my buttons. He will cry/scream for 3-4 hours straight with nothing wrong, I kid you not. If I offer him food during this he crushes it up and throws it around. He is unplugging all the cords in the house trying to get into the fishtank, just generally doing stuff he knows he shouldnt and then laughing when we get upset with him. Time outs don't work. he just screams the whole time and I feel like nothing is accomplished. He wont sleep. Nap time is horrid. Everyday at 11 we make him nap, but it takes so long to get him to stop screaming and kicking the door/walls and actually go to sleep. Same thing for bedtime, but like 10 times worse.
routine:
7 am wake up have breakfast
play (outside if nice)
have a light lunch/snack
11 am nap time (when he does finally fall asleep he will nap 1-2 hours)
have 2nd light lunch/snack
play (outside if nice)
have family time with mom and dad
7pm have dinner
have bath right after
read two stories in bed
sleep time at 830-9 pm
any advice?

"My son will be 4 in January. Starting about 2mos ago my husband & I noticed he wasn't staying in bed in the early mornings (around 6-7am). He's always had a late schedule (bed at 10, up at 9) because our household only has one car & my husband doesn't get out of work until 9 so getting my son in bed earlier is just out of the question. I understand he needs less sleep these days, but getting up before 8am or while it's still dark out is simply absurd.
When he started getting up, he would just go in the living room & play,  even though he knows he's supposed to come into my room once he wakes up. Now the behavior has progressed & he's making trouble. Getting into the scissors, taking food from the cupboards, going outside by himself, torturing my poor cats, etc. We cut out naps the same time he started getting up at night & he's still clearly tired. His behavior is off the wall with exhaustion & most of the time when I pick him up from daycare or whichever family member watched him that day, he falls asleep in the car on the way home.
Honestly, I'm out of ideas. Aside from setting up some sort of massive barricade or putting an alarm on his door, I don't know what to do. I'm at my wits end. I'm tired of my child misbehaving DAILY and the punishments just don't seem to get through to him. It's dangerous for him to be up by himself, it scares the hell out of me & I'm losing sleep over this.
Please help me! Tell me I'm not alone & what the hell I'm supposed to do!",6
"My son will be 4 months old on Dec. 4th and he eats SO MUCH that it's worrying me.  He seems to be ok weight-wise (15 lbs) but he eats about every 2 hours, 6 oz each time!  I read something that a baby is only supposed to eat 2.5 oz per lb which would be about 37.5 oz a day.  As of today, he's eating 65-70 oz!!!!!!!!!!!!  I read something about putting rice cereal in his bottle but I don't know if that's safe.  What should I do???",6
"My son will be 6 this month. He has Autism but is generally mildly impaired in terms of functioning. He speaks pretty well but displays some echolalia and expressive language delays. He is starting to read, write, and do things typical for his age. He has a borderline cognitive impairment and right now receives full time ABA, speech therapy, and occupational therapy through my insurance. He should be in Kindergarten but is homeschooled until September while he finishes therapy. I don't want to paint this picture that he is severely impaired, but there are some challenges he faces. To a point I expect some behavioral problems just because of the Autism. He seems to enjoy social interaction with family. He will be enrolled in general education Kindergarten in the fall with supports (resource room, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and perhaps a 1 to 1 aid intermittently). His therapists and I feel he functions well enough to succeed in general education vs a cognitively impaired classroom. He rarely has self injurious or aggressive behaviors nowadays. I'm talking less than once a month. He doesn't understand the concept of personal space well. His comprehension is behind depending on the topic so sometimes I'm not sure how much he understands. He loves his iPad and Leap Pad games and making videos of his life. He doesn't really watch TV. His bedtime is 9:30 PM because he tends to only need 9 hours of sleep a night. We are working on weaning him off fast food and onto a home cooked diet right now. It's going OK with resistance of course. He has a narrow palate but he is trying things I offer and we are mandating that he sits at the table with no electronics for the duration of lunch and dinner. If he doesn't finish then he doesn't get any more food until the next meal time. Quite often though he has a nasty attitude and talks back. He whines a lot. He is very rude to my husband (his step father) randomly and won't let him talk to him. Other times him and my husband play basketball and have a grand old time. Sometimes he can be very aggressive and will hit me in the face when I try to discipline him. This is rare. He has to be very angry to do this. He's also tried to kick me in the stomach recently (I'm pregnant). I explained he would hurt the baby and he hasn't done it again. Sometimes he throws his body weight to the ground when I tell him to go into time out. I'm very small and he's very big for his age so picking him up off the floor is difficult. I'm currently having contractions because of his last episode a few minutes ago where I had to get him up off the floor. When we are in public sometimes he won't listen well and my husband (who is easily embarrassed in public) becomes irate. It puts me in a bad position because I'm trying to get a handle on my son and calm my dramatic husband down. My husband doesn't understand that kids, especially ones with Autism, act up in public and that it's not a reason to be ashamed. He will walk away and leave me alone to deal with my son. I'm just trying to get my son under control before baby #2 is born. I want him to listen better, stop whining, eat what I cook, and not send me into premature labor by fighting with me over time outs. (I delivered him premature at 31 weeks so I'm very worried about this). Any advice for his age or his Autism is appreciated.",6
"My son will be a year old in 6 weeks, and he won't eat food!  He'll eat certain purees if they are thin enough, but won't even attempt finger foods or anything too chunky.  He's currently on formula; my question is--is formula still ok to give after 12 months while I keep trying to introduce food to him?

There was a point where he'd start eating solids, but right when they hit his mouth he'd gag and that caused him to throw up a couple times. He still doesn't chew, even if I show him through example. (He likes feeding me solids)

With everything I've been doing, I cannot believe how hard is been to lose the weight. After the birth of my first child, my body effortlessly went back to it's original shape & weight. It seemed like the only thing I had to do was breastfeed and the weight literally melted off. Not this time. I'm hoping to hear from some other moms because I'm starting to get discouraged.

"My ten year old boy has been sick for a week, he's got a horrible case of a flu.  He's really not coping well, and he seems to have gotten it quite badly.
I'm the only one in the family who's gotten the flu vaccine this year, my husband and my two daughters haven't.
I've also got a young baby, and I'm so horrified at the thought of him getting sick while he's still so young.
I've basically sectioned the house into two zones.  My husband and other children have been isolated from my son for a whole week, and my son has been kept in his bedroom.  I've taken my mattress to his room so I can sleep there, and attend to him whenever he needs.  He's been waking up at night a lot and has been having fevers and trouble sleeping.  My husband and daughters are having no contact with my son, I'm not letting him leave his room until he's deinfected.  Now I'm essentially making him bathe alone, shower alone, eat all his dinners in his bedroom alone, except when I'm there.
I can't even sleep at night, its gotten to me.  He's got really bad shivers and chills, its so depressing to see him like that.  I really want to cry, its completely breaking my heart.

He keeps asking me mummy I can't even sleep at night I can hear his coughing and mutters throughout the night And I think he's scared he knows how sick he is.  He's seen how we've had to isolate him from his family.  They're all worried about him too mummy's here the pain will go away.  But I feel so useless I can't bear to see my son in pain At night he wakes up vomiting sometimes he has no appetite He keeps telling me his head hurts his arms hurt it will get better soon t will be all okay.  He's in bed all the time he hardly wants to get up and move.  His temperatures gotten to the point I've started using cold packs to try to keep the fever down. I  keep calling his doctor telling him how its not resolving He was meant to have started getting better by now but it doesn't look like it at all. I'm taking him in to the doctor tomorrow to get blood tests because I'm so worried this might be something bad and its scaring me. Deep down I know this will pass and its probably nothing too serious. I know he'll get better soon eventually and everything will get back to normal.

The next time my mum was watching my oldest she told me about how much he loved his sticky toffee pudding and I was at there last week and my dad asked if he could have fizzy juice in a bottle. I have been very clear that he is happy drinking water but diluted fruit juice and diluting juice are fine. 
have made mistakes in parenting one of the main ones being giving my oldest a bottle in bed, it was dangerous and took us a lot of long hard stressful work to get him used to not using a bottle and not falling asleep drinking. My mum was well aware of the difficult time we had with this but we agreed during the summer he could have juice during the night because he gets dehydrated easily. I have recently found out that he still gets a bottle there and juice all night. Its making him expect it at home and holding him back.
My mum was also putting a pull up on my oldest an hour or two before bed and its meaning that we have to potty train him again. She also uses baby talk with both boys, we have asked her not to because both boys need as much encouragement as possible to speak properly.
I have spoke to my mum about all of this but she does it anyway. What can I do now? My mum is my only babysitter but I am seriously considering not allowing my boys to stay anymore if she can't listen to important things about looking care of them.",1
"My wife and I are of the opinion that breast is best but it now appears that our once copious supply of milk is dwindling down.  For nine months she pumped extra on top of feedings since she works nights and the extra milk would help feed my son when she's at work.  We had a freezer full of milk but we are down to our last few bags.  She will continue to feed our son but it now appears that we will have to supplement with formula, much to our disappointment.With that considered does anyone have any advice/recommendations on what formulas work well for you?  BTW, my son is nine months old... if that means anything",6
"My wife and I are parents to an amazing 6 month old boy. He is healthy, and right in line with kids his age. But I'm worried that I'm not a good father and that I don't know how to be. I don't mean to say that I'm in-attentive or uncaring; i love this little kid! What I mean is I don't think I know how to parent.
My wife and I both work, so we only see him for the brief few hours after work before he falls asleep for the night. I want to read to him at night, but I just don't. It always feels like there's no time. How is there never any time?
Also I never know the things I feel I'm supposed to know as a parent, like how much food he should be eating, what kind of activities and games are suitable for him, or what kinds of toys he should be playing with. 
I also recently found out that I shouldn't be feeding him when he's lying down. And the one that scared the shit out of me: I just found out that my favorite thing to make him smile, tossing him up in the air, can cause shaken baby syndrome. How can I, as a parent, be such an idiot? I'm trying, I really am. But everyday it seems that I'm finding out what I've been doing wrong the whole time.
I've never felt like a bad parent, but lately I feel like the worst one ever. How am I supposed to learn how to be a better parent? What else don't I know?",6
"My wife and I both get up, get ready, and get the kid fed before hauling off to work every morning. Many mornings, our daughter will just eat some yogurt with us and the sitter will give her some other snacks later...but lately I've been thinking the we should be getting some more variety and sustenance in her morning meals. 
She likes eggs, so a few days out of the week I'll whip up some scrambled eggs for her. We've tried oatmeal with mixed results, she doesn't seem to like most oatmeal...she does like those cereal bars, but those have a bit more sugar in them than what I like to give her on a daily basis...
Any good ideas on quickly-made breakfasts for toddlers?
EDIT: I swear I wrote this originally...guess not. She's 19 months old.",2
"My wife and I decided to try to set our little boy up on an eating schedule that isn't quite so demanding (every 1.5-2 hours). The problem: if we delay his drink (1 hour after he started giving the subtle hunger signals), he gets so hungry and desperate that as soon as he gets a boob or bottle in his mouth, he chugs so hard he horks down a lot of air. Then, he's still so hungry that when we stop to burp him, he bawls and struggles furiously and can't relax enough to burp. So to stop the skwauking, we give him more to drink. And then he drinks more milk, but less than he normally would because he's full of air. Because he ate on top of the burp, it takes much longer to get all the burps out, and so on, and he ends up being hungry in a shorter time than usual. A big load of fussiness. Any tips welcome, though I'm in favor of just feeding him on his innate schedule for a while longer.",6
"My wife and I have 3 kids. 2 beautiful girls, 8 & 4 (divas) and a 6 month old. My wife is a small woman, 5'3 and 87 pounds",6
"My wife and I have a beautiful 3 month old daughter and a cat that's pretty skittish  The cat has been acting out since we brought our daughter home from the hospital by using our dining room as a litter box, maybe every other day we smell urine in there or find a present.
My wife got the cat from a shelter about 8 years ago, she was badly abused (Cigarette burns all over her). We love the cat and she loves us, she's very skittish around people she doesn't know and will generally hide when we have company but is very loving to us and people she's familiar with.   She doesn't go near the baby or her things at all but I think she's definitely acting out by using our dining room to go to the bathroom in.
We've tried to introduce her to our daughter many times, we even hold the baby when we're feeding the cat so she can see that the baby isn't a threat to her, her food or her territory.
Does anyone have any advice for us? I'm sure we aren't the only ones that this has happened to.  It's getting old really fast.
As a side note: We have tried that fellaway"" spray that is supposed to ease cat's anxiety
Thank you in advance!",6
"My wife and I have a beautiful daughter who will be 4 in January, she is a great kid, well mannered, polite, and respectful, but is having a huge issue with discipline lately. My mother-in-law has always been in our daughters life and a very big part of it! I appreciate all she does for our family but she spoils our daughter (her only grandchild) to death. When I say spoil I mean she gives her what she wants when she wants it at the very second she asks for something. She will never tell our daughter no, not an ounce of discipline when she is with her and she let's her get away with anything and everything. This is causing a big problem at home. Now our daughter seems to think she deserves what she wants when she wants it. When she is being punished (usually a 4 min time out or a loss of privilege such as dessert or bed time story) she flips out screaming for grandma hysterical crying. My mother in law has to talk to our daughter every night on the phone before bed which would be fine if she didn't keep her on the phone for an hour every night which just leads to our daughter hysterical crying for grandma. I know our daughter loves her grandma but when she is pre-occupied with something she is happy with, there is not even a mention of grnadma, it's not until it's time for bed, or time to do something she doesn't wanna do (like eating vegetables) that she cries for grandma. My wife and I have talked about sitting down and talking to my mother in law about this and explain that she needs consistancy and needs rules to follow no matter what house she is in but we both agree that she will not listen, she will yes us until we shut up and she will not change her ways. We have already tried talking to her and she gets defensive and doesnt see she is spoiling our daughter. What do we do next?? Do we stop her from going to grandmas? Do we cut down on the visitation/hour long phone calls? How do we get grandma to enforce rules?? Please help!!!",6
"My wife and I have been married for 14 years and we are thinking about having a baby. I am 32 and she is 34 and we have been having some issues finding a doctor. My wife is well into the plus size category at 370 pounds. Our problem is that no OB/GYN will talk to us about her getting pregnant before she loses a substantial amount of weight. One flat out told us that he wanted her to loose over 100 pounds before he would even consider helping her (she has PCOS and may need some help conceiving) and that if she did get pregnant at her current weight to not bother coming back because he wouldn't see her.
So, my question is, for women who have had a baby while being plus size, did you have any size related complications? Other than being heavy she doesn't have any other health problems like high blood pressure or blood sugar problems that would be an issue during a pregnancy. She doesn't really want to wait too much longer to get pregnant because most of the women in her family had already had to have a hysterectomy by the time they were her age so she might be running out of time.
Editing to add events from today:
We had an appointment with a heart specialist this afternoon, her primary set it up to look into a sightly elevated resting heart rate she has had for years. After checking her out and looking at her most recent blood work and doing some tests we asked him about this. He told us she was in good health heart-wise, they are doing a stress test in a few weeks to rule out anything missed in the exam today but he said that unless something abnormal comes back then that he didn't see anything that would be a concern to him about her becoming pregnant. We have a few other specialists to visit but her heart doctor seems to be satisfied that she will be fine.",6

"My wife is am AMAZING caregiver.  She has a sixth sense for sons needs, usually anticipates them before they come up.   Lately my son has been starting most of his sentences with I want"" or ""I don't want"" and whines and cries if he doesn't get what he wants.  If he melts down  etc etc.  My son ends up getting a shower of affection and care from her and almost always feels better.  Today he was ""hungry and hot"" and refused to go through with soccer practice.  I encouraged him to push through it  to finish the practice.  I believe struggle builds character My wife thinks I am deliberately trying to hurt him.  Thats the the last think I want to do.  I just think the boy needs more experiences where he doesn't get what he wants  needs a little struggle in his life to learn about himself.  I also think he needs to learn do things his parents tell him to do whether he's hungry or happy or tired or whatever.  Am I being too hard on him?  Is this not the age to doubt his complaints or ask him to override his biological situation and do something he doesn't want to do?  Am I overly paranoid about spoiling my kid?   """,6

My question is the following:

"Not sure if this is the correct sub, but currently I am a stay at home dad and I am looking after my 2 month old. I started feeding her 5 ounces when she turned 1 month because she was not getting satisfied at all. I would distract her and give her her pacifier and nothing. Yesterday they measured her and weighed her and she is 24 inches long and 24 lbs!!!
20538,
20539,I been trying to reduce the amount she drink,formula, but she goes berserk if I dont give her more. My good ear is going bad already as loud as my baby is crying.  I asked her pediatrician and she said give her the amount she wants as long as she is not spitting up too much.
20540,
20541,What do you guys suggest I do to reduce her intake on formula or should I just feed her as normally? I googled and all the babies around her age are half he weight. She doesn't look fat, everything is pretty well distributed.
20542,
20543,If it provides anymore info 9lbs and 21 inches long at birth so she was a decent sized baby.

20546,Edit: thank you all for your info and experiences. There is not a lot of positive parenting advice around me since every just thinks about dumping their kids to their parents and going out to party. This really calmed me down and gave me more confidence when taking care of my baby :).

"Not sure of this belongs but its my much needed rant time. My 7 month old had decided he will not sleep, doesn't matter when or where he is refusing to sleep, some times of we are lucky he will sleep with us. He has been super cranky for weeks now, he has also started sleeping in until 9am which wouldn't be a problem if he wasn't staying up until 11pm-12am. We do bath, book, singing and boobie to sleep at 7-7:30 and he goes to sleep. But 30 mins to an hour later he is up and nothing works, I've laid and feed him from 8-11pm for a few weeks and nothing, some nights I fall asleep first. I've tried letting him cry some, I've tried waiting till later for bed time I've tried bed time earlier, I've tried having him sleep alone, which never works. Its driving me crazy, I never get any me time anymore. He has also all but stopped his naps. He is up at 9, and by 10 he is tired, his normal nap time, so we put him down, if my boyfriend falls asleep and naps with him he will have a 1:30-2hr nap. But if he naps alone it will be 30 mins max. Then he's up and within an hour he is tired and ready for a nap again. Which leads to another 30 min nap and a overly tired cranky baby all day long! It all started around 6 1/2 months but its gotten so much worse. He has just started crawling a week ago, so we thought that might be it but it hasn't been getting better. He has also started screaming, want to put him down for a second? Screams, won't let him hurt himself? Screams. Try to put him down to sleep? More screaming. Loud, screaming. We know nothing is wrong but that mixed with no sleeping is driving me up the wall! I need him to sleep so I can wind down at the end of the day. ",6
"Now before I start I just want to say all babies are different, mine may be young but I know that she was ready for real food to be added to her diet. So no rude comments. 
Lo is 4 m.o. She started sucking on frozen fruit when she got a hold of a strawberry one day, so I decided to start her on some cereal. She eats it sometimes but prefers flavored over plain. We do give her applesauce from time to time but not every day as I try more of the cereal so that her digestive system can get used to things. Well we've been doing this for about 2 weeks. She eats food only in the morning, sometimes every other morning, but she hasn't pooped in about 3-4 days... Is this normal? Is her body jut taking most of the nutrients so she hasn't needed to poop yet
Thanks. ",6
"Now that my 6 month old is regularly having some baby food every day, I need to decide on a baby food mill to make his pur√©ed meals.
I was planning on getting the infantino squeeze station & wondered if any of you had comments on it - like/dislike it?
Any other suggestions?",2
"Now that my twins are 1, I know it is time to switch from formula to milk.  Im just confused.
A typical day looks like this:
7am - formula bottle 10am - meal 1 (eggs/ toast), followed by a formula bottle
2pm - meal 2 (veg/ sandwich), followed by a formula bottle
6pm - meal 3 (various), followed by a formula bottle
Q1.  Do I simply replace the formula for milk in all 4 bottles?
Q2.  Should I eliminate bottle all together and use sippies for milk?
Q3.  Do you think my mealtimes should be altered to be 3 meals instead of 4?  Or perhaps change the times so breakfast (meal 1) occurs upon waking?
Q4.  Can you recommend any good resources that spell this out?",6
"Ok first and foremost let me state that I absolutely love my mother in law, we have been friends for a few years and yes I say friends bc I considered her my friend for those first years, and still do to some extent. I say this bc everything I am about to say I don't want to come off as hateful or judgmental, but I am going to be brutally honest.
She asks to come spend time with her grandson with which we always say yes. But when she comes into my house she spends half of her attention on him and the other half cleaning the bathroom or going in my room to get laundry, doing dishes etc. I've asked her several times not to do this, and to please just hang out with our son. She insists she just trying to help but it's at the point where it drives me nuts, I feel insecure when she's here as if she's trying to say I'm not doing enough as a stay at home mom. And I feel as though this actually has some validity bc a few weeks back she gave me a lecture on my relationship with my husband which I felt was really harsh and rude (being that she said all of this I front of my friend and her daughter who were over at the time) she went on and on about how she saw a pregnancy test in the bathroom and what kind of birth control we were using and how her son should be wearing a condom or I should not let him have sex with me bc we cannot handle another baby, she went on to tell me after I said I wanted to do a date night with my husband that she thought we couldn't even enjoy anytime with each other so it would be a waste for us. Then she went on to tell me that he works 8 hours a day so I should be putting in a least 8 hours every day cleaning. I told her my job isn't 8 hours, it's 24 hours a day and I don't get weekends off, I love it but I don't have 8 hours a day to clean, i feed, change nap my child plus play with him, etc. on top of that I do all household chores, my husband gets breakfast most mornings, I make lunch when he comes home, and when he gets off work the house is clean and dinner is made... I don't know what else she expects! She told me that sometimes she comes over there are things all over the floor (umm like toys from my toddler?!) She over thinks everything, cancels on us at literally the last minute for everything, lectures us on money spending, lifestyle choices, church... I mean literally everything. I used to consider her a friend bc that's how I felt about her, and I still do to some extent but it's beginning to feel like a parent trying to control a teenager. Now let me say in the beginning months of our sons birth we did have a lot of struggles and stess, it took my husband a year to find a job, we had a son born with a. Birth defect needing multiple surgeries, we just moved to a new state etc. but we are both 28 with college degrees, we are fairly responsible I like to think, we have always provided for our son first, we are fully committed to each other, don't get me wrong we have had our issues and still do, but this year has been so much better for both of us and for our family... I just feel really terrible when she does these things, especially the cleaning it drives me nuts!! I've tried to give her special projects to do with my son when she comes over so that she can focus her time on him, but she just rolls her eyes and ignors me... I've asked her jot to clean, told her I don't need the help, and all I need her to do is watch my son, but she's says she just can't help herself. It's gotten to the point where she puts my underware away I my drawer where I have sex toys, or washes my period underware for me... (Sorry tmi) but it really feels like she's trying to show me up, or show me how to be a better wife and mother. I can't handle it anymore and I don't know what to do... Sorry for the ranting if anyone has had similar experiences what helped you? ",6

"ok so my 13 week old son loves loves loves his nightly baths. He smiles a lot and splashes in the water. However when it's time to get out of the bath he screams his head off while I try to put lotion on him and dress him. You know that really deep like I'm emotionally hurt"" kind of crying. Not a simple I'm hungry cry. It takes a really like time to calm him down. This has been happening for a week now! Anyone know what's going on?

"Ok so, My daughter is about 11 months old. She has never, EVER gone to sleep in her crib. What has always happened is that she falls asleep with me holding her and then I put her in the crib once she's asleep. If I try to put her in the crib before she is completely asleep, she starts screaming and jumps up reaches out to me and gives me this Why have you forsaken me?"" look. So it takes me about 20 min to an hour to get her to sleep and in a deep enough sleep that I can put her in the crib. So I guess the first advice I'm looking for is... have I ruined anything? I mean †tender holding †playing/teaching you only do it on your time and not when they need it. I do know I may take it too far sometimes but I'm really paranoid about keeping my secure attachment with her (brag moment: our attachment is textbook secure! yay!!). So is this a common thing to let your baby fall asleep in your arms before putting them in the crib? If not is it detrimental in any way? If so †what should I do to fix it? The other thing I need advice about is feeding. When Adahliah first started eating solids at about 6 months she preferred solids over the bottle by a lot. Then she doesn't want to eat anything. She only wants her formula with rice cereal or oatmeal mixed in. Every night I feel like I waste so much money in food because I put her down to eat and put the food there and she either screams to get out of the chair mashes the food up and plays with it or throws it on the floor for the dog to eat. And it's not just wasting money of course. I'm worried she is not healthy because she isn't eating enough. And what am I going to do in a month when she's supposed to stop the formula? How will she get her nutrients!? I'm getting really worried about it... any advice would be so much appreciated. Sorry so long! P.S. This is my first reddit post ever! Woot!""",2
"Ok, daughter is 9 (4th grade) and has been asking, repeatedly, if Santa is real or not. Most of her friends already don't believe in Santa anymore so it's going to happen, if not already and we are just confirming what she thinks. 
So here's what I'm thinking. Xmas eve, call her downstairs after all the other kids are in bed (ours and family staying over). Tell her she gets to **be** Santa for the kids and gets to help us eat cookies and wrap the presents. When she asks about her presents I'll just reply, well After she goes up to bed (we usually stay up late on xmas eve) we'll put out her presents. Personally  I like the idea of her understanding that someone is putting the presents out for her but never hearing from us directly that there is no Santa. Because there is a Santa :)""",6
"Ok, I'm not sure if picky eater is even the right word for it. My 5 year old just doesn't eat meals. She only wants to graze all day. And if she asks me for something specific to eat (today it was oatmeal) and I make it for her, she'll take maybe one bite then refuse to eat it. Even if it's something small, something she loves, she simply won't eat it even after she begs me to make it. 
I'm at my wit's end, it becomes a battle of wills, if I make her sit there and eat it she will literally sit there for hours, until it's either time to go to school or time for bed. I don't understand how she's getting any nutrition at all because she won't eat!",1

Should I be feeding her baby food? how do you start that?

"Ok, So I have Short Term Disability until June 7. As of June 4th my man has a job for the summer, so until mid Sep. that pays very well and all our needs would be covered for that time. My job barely covers all our bills and would not cover a babysitter so my man would have to stay home to watch out son but we still would have no money for food, gas for car or any extras at all including baby needs. So basically we need two incomes or for my man to have a well paying job that goes beyond just this summer. He put in his two weeks notice at his current part time job because they have messed with him a lot with hours and now a co-worker is accusing him of sexual harassment and he is so not that kind of man. He is engaged and a father. He couldn't be more traditional and respectful of others. So after this summer he will have no job and mine expects me back soon. But with no money for a babysitter how would it be even worth it? I'm not sure how I should work this out. If I could stay home until my man's job is done and then go back to work that might be ok. It seems like whatever way I turn I have no resource. I do have wic and working on welfare right now to get my food stamps back and baby added to medical but not sure how long that will take. I'm all confused on what to do with my job. I wont be guaranted my position back if I stay out longer since I don't qualify for the FMLA thing. If they let me go I wont get unemployment since they are a non profit organization. I'm lost on what to do. I want to stay home with my son more than anything. I'm just so stressed out.",6

Today for instance, shes had a cup of milk, bowl of oatmeal (1 packet) and two scrambled eggs. She just told me shes still hungry, but I dont see how. Ive heard and read over and over that your kid won't starve themselves and you should let them eat until theyre full, but I'm a little skeptical of that. For her age she should be getting between 1000-1400 calories a day, which is fine and definitely doable, but I'm kind of wondering if she really is still hungry or if she's saying it just to say it. I dont want to over feed her and become a childhood obesity statistic, but I don't wanna starve her. What are your experiences? And is this just normal toddler behavior?",2
"Okay Mamas I need some help/suggestions. I have an eight month old who loves table food! He eats two meals a day (breakfast and dinner). I know that he should still be getting formula, which he does, but I'm lucky if I get 20oz a day into him. He will take a six ounce bottle before nap time after breakfast, maybe 2 4-6 oz bottles during the day and then one 6-8 oz bottle at night right before bed. Is this enough for him? He's not huge nor really all that tiny (maybe 19#). He is happy and plays all day. Crawls around everywhere. My MIL says she had a hard time getting my husband to eat anything until he was about 8 years old. I'm just wondering if this is enough for him or if I should try to get him to take more.",2
"Okay my MIL.  
She's generally okay and I can tolerate her for the most part but lately she's just down right pissing me off.
She doesn't listen to anything I tell her.  It's like she thinks it's a funny game or something to do the complete opposite of what I ask for my daughter.
There's too many to mention but just last weekend we were over there for breakfast and my 17mth old is now in a booster seat on a regular chair at the table.  She's recently been pulling her feet onto the table.  Where we eat.  Aww cute right?  Yeah maybe the first time.  
So here I am trying to teach my VERY impressionable 17mth old that it's not okay and feet don't go on the table.  Well doesn't my MIL start talking about HOW CUTE her feet are and pulls them out and plops them on the table.  I told her that I don't want her doing that and that it might be funny but I don't allow it so enough said and put her feet back under.  Well a few minutes go by and there she goes again.  After the third time I slightly snapped at her saying Julie THEEENNNNN we're ""playing"" in the LR DD is throwing herself onto big pillows.  My MIL takes her onto the couch and proceeds to ""teach"" her how to ROLL OFF OF THE COUCH!!  WTF.  She did it twice until I rrealized what the heck was going on and took the pillows away and said  ""NO we're not going to teach DD how to roll off a couch"" she responded that it's fun though.  I'm like  not stuck watching her every move.  If you teach her to roll off the couch like it's a fun way to spend the day then she's going to do it at home when we're not looking and land on a hardwood floor.  Is that not stupid?  I mean she's 17mths old not 5.  She doesn't understand that there isn't a pillow catching her fall at this age. Oh oh and then there's my SIL who feeds DD eggs minutes after telling her we think DD has an allergy due to symptoms from the last time.  We have an appt with allergist that isn't until may I should add.  So no Then last weekend a few fmaily members are playing really rough and running around like crazy.  I tell my SIL not to bring DD by the stairs where all this action is happening.  She does it anyway  puts DD on the stairs and then turns around to talk to people and whaddya think happens?  DD falls down the stairs (3 steps) and lands on her face.  I run over and grab her SIL leaves the house upset because my husband yelled her name at her when it happened as if to say WTF.  She comes back in the house and literally had the nerve to yell at us that the only reason DD is crying is because we reacted.  I yell back  no Mel The women in this family have no respect for mine and my husbands rules with our daughter and it makes me fume! My SIL's 11yr old daughter is a total spaz and so rude.  She farts  burps  rarely says please or thank you without being told to and slides off her chair and - wait for it - puts her bare feet on the table!!  And it's becasue this mother and daughter duo raised this girl.  No way in hell is my daughter going to be raised without respect.  I was raised by a mother who knew the importance of manners.  I wasn't by any means an angel but I listened and was polite and that's what I want to raise my daughter as. Rant over Sorry  apparently I REALLLLYYY needed to get that out of my system.  I can breathe easy now.  ;)""",6
"Okay so a little background. I am almost 30 and have two children. I never managed to successfully breastfeed. My older son was in the hospital so I couldn't and after two weeks of sleep deprivation with my second because I couldn't fill him up I quit. I am currently pregnant with my third and would really like to try again. I a going to see a lactation consultant in the hospital but wanted to do my own research. The problem I am having is most of the breastfeeding websites I have been to spout off the breast is best"" tirades about how horrible it is to formula feed. I don't like those sorts of biased websites...I formula fed both my older kids and I don't want some website telling me I am a failure because of it. So does anyone know of any good tools that don't have those extreme biases toward breastfeeding.†I hope no one takes any offense to this post I just want information from sources that think moms who formula feed or breastfeed are still superheroes either way.""",6
"Okay so first time parent here, so handle me with care. 
My son is 15 months old and as of currently, he jabbers a lot of nonsense and only says momma and daddy.
He walks, runs, climbs down from things and knows how to throw, drink from sippies and when you call his name he knows who you are talking about.
My thing is, although i know the whole milestone"" thing is a generalization Do children generally start phrasing closer to the age of two?
Also my son has been trying to swallow noodles and other soft things whole lately.  He has 11 teeth  and he used to chew up everything but now even the gerber puffs ( like cheetos almost) he lets set in his mouth until it desolves and soft fruit cups and noodles he swallows WHOLE. I tell him "" no Is this a phase?
And a last question  when is the best time to potty train a child? Closer to 3 yrs of age? My son enjoys picking at the tabs on his diaper and keeps undoing them or tearing them. We've just started putting shorts on him to prevent it. Others say putting a footless full body zip up pajama on backwards works  but its nearly summer so he normally only sleeps in shorts any how Ive also heard people say  use duct tape across the tabs so th cant peel them off. I know hes not ready for potty training yet  because just wants to stick his hand in the toilet and mss with the handle and the lid Any info is greatly appreciated! """,2
"Okay so my 11 week old lo has been having a range of different poops and I don't know if I ahould be concerned or not. So Sunday all day she had green poop. Everything was normal except it was green. Fast forward to Tuesday and she gets her first round of vaccines. After having the rotavirus vaccine she became very gassy and had a few bad tummy aches but was still having normal bms. On either Wednesday or Thursday she began to have mucusy poops. We called the ped and they said as long as it wasn't over an extended period of time it was fine. Since then it's cleared up a little bit until today. Earlier today she had mucusy diarrhea. And then just a few mintues ago she had green poop again minus the mucus. Is this all normal?? Oh and she is breastfed and is feeding long enough for it to not be a foremilk/hinemilk imbalance. I also cut of milk and cheese for my diet at the very beginning. Edited to say she has no signs of an infection (i.e. fever, cough, runny nose)",6
"Okay so my 22 month old has literally been down to 6 things he will eat now for the last 2 months. That's it 6 things. Yogurt, Cheerios, crackers, apples, PB&J sandwiches and smoothies. I have tried every trick I can think of and to no avail. My 4 year old isn't much better and they like opposite things. I am so frustrated and tired of spending time and money on home cooked meals and then throwing theirs out (mangled and half regurgitated not fit to served later). Worst is that sending the smallest to bed hungry only has us up half the night with him because he's hungry. If I give in and give him what he wants then I'm a short order cook. So damned if I do and damned if I don't. I'm about to give up and say the hell with it and start making them smoothies for dinner with spinach and steak in them. Seriously!",1
"Okay, I have a 4 year old and a 19 month old and fuck me if I can get them to eat anything outside of PB&J , yogurt, cereal, grapes and kraft dinner. Meal planning and cooking has become so frustrating that it's now my most hated house hold task above cleaning toilets and washing floors. I have tried Mommit....I have tried just about everything; bribing, threatening, putting it out for breakfast, and sending them to bed hungry. You know what? they don't care; they will go to bed hungry and you know who pays for that? I do... at about 5 am. Ugh! Every day I throw out half the food I make. †I didn't dare vent this to my mom friends on FB, the last thing I want to hear is how good of an eater their kid has always been. Anyone else out there this frustrated with thier picky eaters?",1
"Okay, I have an 8 month old baby girl. She's about 14 lbs and 26 in long. She crawls like a dream, says: bad, baba, mom, dada and papa. She can stand up while holding onto things and is starting to stand up on her own. Now, onto the feeding. She breastfed until she was 2 months, and then she switched to formula. She has around 24-32 ounces during the day and wakes up 1-2 times at night for more. She's been eating solids since she was 5 months. She was up to 3 times a day, but in the last few days she has progressed to wanting to eat finger foods. Is it okay that she's already eating finger foods? Her diapers are the same and he gas has been the same as always. But is it to early? And sleeping. She takes about 3-4 naps a day. Ranging from 30 minutes to an hour. She usually goes to sleep between 7:30 and 8. But these last few days she's been tired and wanting bed between 6:30 and 7. She wakes up around 11 for a bottle, and around 3-4. I know that wanting that last bottle at 11 can be common. But her pediatrician said that with her weight she shouldn't be waking up at all and should sleep 11-12 hours without feedings. Any help for a tired, first time mom? Edit: Yesterday, I wrote down everything she did to see if there's anything I could change, but she slept last night! Here's how her day went: 7:15 - Woke up 7:25 - Tried to eat Mandarin Oranges and Pears, wasn't hungry 7:35 - Had floor time 8:25 - Had 4 oz of a 6 oz bottle and went in swing 8:45 - Got out of swing because she couldn't sleep 8:50 - Had baby food Pears, 1/4 of a jar 9:00 - Had bath 9:20 - Got dressed, played 10:30 - Went in swing with 6 oz bottle 11:30 - Woke up, poopy diaper change 11:40 - Had floor time 11:50 - Ate 8 Turkey&Vegetable Toddler Raviolis 12:30 - Played in Jenny Jump Up 12:50 - Took Tylenol for teeth 12:55 - Had Apple Cinnamon Snacks in Excersaucer 1:10 - Swing with a 6 oz bottle 3:10 - Woke up, poopy diaper change 3:25 - Got dressed 3:30 - Had floor time 4:00 - Ate Wheat Thins, Mandarin Oranges, Blood Oranges, and Mac N Cheese Toddler 5:20 - Pee diaper change 5:30 - Hung out with Daddy 6:00 - Took bath 6:20 - Put on PJ's, took Gripe Water and Tylenol 6:30 - On crib with 6 oz bottle 12:30 - Woke up for 6 oz bottle 7:10 - Woke up 7:15 - Pee diaper change 7:20 - Excersaucer with some Apple Cinnamon Snacks 7:30 Ate Ritz Crackers and Mandarin Oranges",2
"Okay, so here it goes (bear with me, this is my first real post (longtime lurker). I became a FTM in March of this year. My DH and I have been together for 14 years and married for 2.5. Up until I became pregnant I had a friendly relationship with my MIL, but after we announced my pregnancy things took a nosedive and have been getting progressively worse...
My MIL is nearly 60, however she acts more like she's 21. She does not financially support herself and relies on her 80+ year old mother for support. She had an entry level payroll job and decided it was to stressful"" and quit to collect unemployment. She lives very close by in her mom's house (she lives elsewhere) and has TRASHED it. I'm not being snarky when I say that it should be leveled. She has a bathroom that's rotted to the studs Thanks for hanging in  here's where I need help. From nearly day one of my relationship with my DH she would make jokes about wanting us to get pregnant and to give her the baby (she has to grown sons). Well fast forward a number of years and my DH and I were pregnant. She was a pain in the butt while I was pregnant but it was NOTHING in comparison to what transpired later.  Here's a sample of some of her ""greatest hits"": 1. Refer to herself as ""Momma"" when speaking to and about my LO. 2. Attempt to wake the baby so she can hold/play with her. 3. Ask to take her in her car WITHOUT a car seat. 4. Complains that we don't visit her house even though the a/c doesn't work. It is over 100 degrees where we live and the inside of her house is even hotter. 5. Refuses to give a pumped bottle when LO is hungry and she is holding her. DH had to practically yell at her over this. 6. Complains that I BF in another room while she is visiting or if we are visiting her (if it's cool enough out). She has stated that she thinks I do it to keep her away from the baby (I'm boob shy and like some privacy). 7. Complains if she isn't pushing the stroller. 8. Complains that we haven't asked her babysit (my DH agrees that this will not be an option because of her irresponsibility). 9. She wanted me to hire her to watch LO instead of daycare so she doesn't have to get a ""real"" job. 10. Had a temper tantrum because we wouldn't let one of her friends smoke pot in the presence of my child or around me/DH. After we brought my LO home I wanted a few days to ourselves so I could heal and adjust to my new family. As soon as we welcoming family over she would come over and would't listen to a thing we said. The bay's sleeping? ""Wake her up so I can hold her"". Baby's hungry? ""No she's not he needs tone rocked"". Baby's diaper needs to be changed? ""No If we call her out out when she does stupid things like try to wake the baby she has full meltdowns and stomps off and ignores us. She can't be reasoned with...how do we handle this? I honestly feel that she is dangerous because she's so convinced that her behavior is normal? Also he has not contacted me ONCE since LO was about 3 weeks old. If she wanted to see me she sends a text to my DH asking to coordinate with me...I'm the monster who won't let her get away with murder. My DH has spoken with her many times Here's another example of her recent behavior. My DH's BF asked him to be his sons Godfather and the very intimate baptism was this past Saturday. It's well known in our families that my DH and I are not religious and have no plans to do the same (i'm not catholic however my DH was baptized as a baby...has never been to church). My MIL begged my DH to ask that she be invited to watch my DH participate in the ceremony...fine. Well say a quick ""hello"" to everyone and try to settle in for the service. My MIL stomps by me in the fray and sits behind me (whole pew was open next to me). The service is beginning and I have a crying baby on my hands. The baptism party (including MIL) gets up to approach the alter about 20-25 feet away and I hang back to tend to LO. My MIL doesn't way a word and is taking a million pics on her iPhone (she even stood on the alter but I digress). About halfway in LO has a full on blowout diaper and naturally the bathroom door is obscured by the baptism. No big deal My DH had it out with her again yesterday. I'm so over this. She does't listen AT ALL. Obviously I want what's best for my little family but I don't know where MIL fits in. I'm so tired of this and don't know how to get through to her. I feel really guilty too because I realize that I just don't like her anymore. She's a bad example for my child But mom! What do you mean I can't eat the cheeto I found under the cushions?!""",6
"Okay, so I am jobless, I worked in a factory, the pay was great, and I got decent hours, but then in February I was laid off due to there being no work. I have not been able to find a job since. 
I have tried many places since to find a job (most are minimum wage $7.50 an hour jobs), but the cost of daycare is on the rise (it went from being 150 a week to almost 300), I just can't afford to pay bills, gas, a babysitter, and things for my son.  Recently someone told me I should go back to college, get a degree and work from home. I've tried researching good stay at home jobs for moms, but I'm getting nothing but scams and the run around. 
I know most of you are asking 'how have you survived this long with no job, bills, and a kid?'
Well, when I had a job, I did nothing but go to work, and come back home. I saved my money, enough to last me this long, but my money is running low. 
I've even tried going and asking for government assistance (I was only able to receive a low amount for food stamps and health care for my son), I've tried the job training center, but they are full and aren't accepting any more people till August. 
I just don't know what to do right now. 
Any advice for someone who really needs it right now?
Edit: Thank you to everyone for there great suggestions. I finally got a call back last week for a job! I'm super stocked to start working again. ",6
"Okay, so I finally have a few free minutes to type this out. Sorry about the wall of text. My doctors decided that I needed to be induced Tuesday night, January 8th, because my blood pressure would not go down. They let me leave to get my stuff and just have a few free moments to myself before going back to the hospital, so I went out to eat and then got my stuff, my best friend, and the father of my baby. I arrived at the hospital at about 7:30 pm. I was nervous as hell, but also excited. My doctor checked my cervix, i was about 1 and 1/2 centimeters dilated so they put a pill in my cervix to soften it up. I wasn't allowed to move for about 2 hours. Near the end of those two hours I started having contractions. At first I thought I just had gas, because that's what it felt like. But they wouldn't stop. They checked me again and I was at about 3 cm. All through the night I kept having contractions, and it got so bad that at one point I asked for some morphine. They gave me a small amount, and although it didn't make the pain go away, it gave me that high/giggly feeling and I really couldn't care about the pain anymore. The father was there with me the whole time, laying in bed with me and holding me tight even though he got yelled at me for it. (Plus, he wanted to sleep and my best friend had stolen the recliner). I never did end up getting any sleep that night, and I was so grateful when they gave me the epidural in the morning. My anesthesiologist was really great and it didn't hurt a bit. That numbness was the best feeling ever, and I think I actually managed to get a little sleep. Since I wasn't in pain anymore, my SO went home to freshen up. I didn't mind, he lives right down the street from the hospital. At about noon they gave me the pitocin (sp?) so that we could speed things along. Soon, the contractions got worse, and I could somewhat feel them, even after two extra doses of the epidural. It felt like someone kicking me in the tailbone. About an hour later they checked me again, and said I was 5 cm. Woo-hoo! Halfway there, right? The pain in my tailbone kept getting worse though, and I told my nurse, who checked me again. It was about half an hour later and I was 8 cm and still progressing quickly! My SO wasn't back yet, so I called him, frantic, as they shut off the pitocin. He said that he would be back as soon as possible. From then until birth, I lost track of time. I remember soon getting the urge to push, and screaming that I needed to. That woke up my best friend, and she came over to me and I held her hand so tightly that I'm surprised it isn't bruised now. The doctor told me there was just a tiny bit of my cervix left, and to hold off on pushing just a few more minutes. My SO called, and I told him to hurry his ass up just as the doctor told me that it was okay to push. I was still on the phone when I started pushing, it hurt so bad but felt so relieving. I pushed a for a few minutes, and finally, my SO shows up only a couple minutes before little Jonathan starts crowning. He held my hand, told me I was doing great and encouraged me to push when I needed to. I remember that pushing out his head felt like fire. I screamed bloody murder, even though I had the epidural and the doctor put some numbing medication down there. Thanks to the numbness though, I didn't feel her have to cut me (stitches hurt by the way). Finally I pushed out his head. I screamed so loud I'm sure the whole hospital heard me. Two more pushes and he was out. I was so relieved, I couldn't stop smiling. My SO started crying. And right then, my family arrived. Little Jonathan Alexander was born 1/9/13 at 1:46 pm. He weighed 6 pounds, 11 ounces, and his apgar score was 9:9 :)",6
"Okay, so I just did my interview, showed off my cupboards, and on Thursday my kids get to be interviewed about everything from my disciplinary style to how much alcohol is consumed in the house to what they get to eat... and all because of jam sandwiches.
See my youngest usually takes a jam sandwich. This is because I am lower-income, and refuse to buy pig anus and chicken feet ground up and made into log form and feed it to my kids. I only by good quality meat from real cuts of meat and so I can only do it a couple of times a month and it goes fast - other times I supplement with tuna or salmon from a can, but you can't do that much because of mercury...
So the staple is the jam sandwich. I don't buy jelly. Sometimes, we even make the jam ourselves. My reasoning is that I would rather they ate something sweet that used to be a piece of fruit than ... christ knows what's even really in bologna... ew. 
But I also do it because my son's school has an unspoken rule"" about eating your sandwich first So often my youngest will come home from school and immediately wolf down all his snacks because he was not allowed to eat all day... because he refused his sandwich. Ergo So often my youngest will come home from school and immediately wolf down all his snacks because he was not allowed to eat all day... because he refused his sandwich. Ergo  the jam sandwich. Seriously... it's just a fucking sandwich... and I've been making them for over a decade...  But am I cracked? Are jam sandwiches a children's services issue? Am I nuts for being pissed that NOBODY from the lunch monitor to the principal and even in the children's services themselves stopped and said ""How is this supposed to be enforceable?

"Okay.  So, my oldest child, Isabel, is five years old.  Tonight she came running to me, crying, telling me her tooth was loose.  There was a little blood around it, but not much at all.  She told me she had been chewing on her jump rope and noticed it was loose.  She was freaking out and so I calmed her down and told her that everyone loses their baby teeth and that she's just becoming a big girl!
I'm pretty sure I blocked ALL of my tooth losing days (I had a real issue with dentists as a kid and by association, my mouth), so there's a lot I don't remember.
I told her to keep wiggling it and now she's pretty excited about the idea of losing it, but I have some questions.  How long until it falls out?  Should I pull it out for her after it becomes looser?  Should I just let it fall out by itself?  Should I give her an apple or something to eat when the tooth gets looser to help it fall out?

Last night, he fussed a bit at 4 hours but was completely dry and when I tried to feed him he just fell asleep again. I tried to wake him up but no dice. So he slept another 3 and a half hours.  He woke up and ate normally and is now going back to sleep.

"Open Letter to the Newest Person I Know
Dear Lennon,
Thanks for joining us.  Along with your brothers Ezra and Miles, you're one of the best reasons I've got for being a better person.  I'm so glad you're here because now instead of evaluating the world, in terms of the two boys in my life, I now have a little girl in my world.  This world, from where I stand, isn't always keen on caring for girls of any age. More on that later.
You've been alive for a few hours.  I've had Dexter Marathons that have lasted longer than your whole life so far. More on that much later. In these few hours, actually in the first few seconds that you and I shared air in the same room, I came to love you.  Profound, inexplicable love overwhelmed me and your uncle with the tattoos cried like a...well a you.  I love you because my sister and my brother in law made you.  I love you because you don't know anything and have very little opinion about anything outside of nipples, and I respect that. You're pink and weird and have tiny parts that are doing what they do for the first time.  Scientists tell me that it will be a long time before you recognize me.  That's okay, take your time.  I think Ez and Miles will vouch for me. One day I hope to come into your house and hear you yell out Uncle Adam!""  Until thenHaving nephews is easy.  We pee in front of each other.  There's farting. There's loud music and talk of girls with Ezra and cars and ninjas with Miles.  I'm better with the ninjas.  With boys my uncle duties are about exposure to cool and fun elements of the world: guitars and Woody Allen and jeeps and The Talking Heads and sandwiches and antique stores and video games and advice that doesn't make sense and being your fan and helping your conquer.  But you're my niece.  You'll need privacy when you pee and you'll have these feminine moments that I know about but can't experience.  My instinct with you is protection and nurture. You may not want to conquer you may want to improve what you find here. Having this new thingAll of a sudden all this internet that's full of porn (more on that never) restaurants that have shitty food served by women in young girls' clothing So here's the deal.  I'm going to get your back in a big way.  You're not going to need me and your dad and your older brothers to protect you from douchey guys.  We're going to spend our time together validating you for valid reasons.  I'm sure you'll be beautiful my people breed pretty. What's better is that you'll be shockingly equipped.  You're going to grow up with men in your life who tell you you're kind and smart and generous and funny.  Sadly  but go hard.  I hope you love something weird like math or geology.  I don't know anything about those things so we'll watch Discovery channel and then have some adventures.  If you're into fashion I will wear whatever you make me.  I will eat what you cook me I will mend what you bring to me broken I will play music you can dance to and ask you to sing even if you're only as good as me. Even if you're worse which you won't be.  I will do these things not only because you'll be impossible to resist but because I value you.  You.  Your little 5 hour old self. You should get into golf there's a ton of scholarship money in Women's Golf.You will not have daddy issues.  I know your dad and your grandads.

"Our 18 month daughter (first and only kid) refuses to drink milk.  She'll have chocolate milk occasionally, but all in all, she doesn't want anything to do with it.  We have her on toddler formula which she drinks 6-8 ozs at night.  We have her on this because we're afraid she's not getting everything she needs with what she eats.  
Typically, she eats cheesy-eggies for breakfast with toast and fruit for breakfast, lunch meat (usually turkey/ham) and cheese with a fruit/veggie pouch for lunch and whatever dinner meat we're eating (usually chicken) with more cheese, fruit and whatever fresh veggie we can get her to eat.  She drinks water and juice throughout the day.  
I talked with her doc about the formula and lack of milk and he said that its OK to keep her on formula for the time being, but I don't want her to get attached to it, which leads me to my next concern.  Her doctor said to wean her from her bedtime bottle ASAP, which would mean weaning her from formula too.  I'm confused and just want to do whats best for Lily.
Any suggestions or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.",6

"Our 4 month old is starting to sleep through the night. And i mean 7-10 hours at night. However, my husband makes me feel like a terrible mom about it.  He says 8 hours is too long, even 6 is too long. He says no baby on the planet does that, that there's no way it's beneficial to their development to sleep that long. he says there's no way I can convince him that 6-8 hours is normal, even if it comes from a doctor, because he said the doctor won't say that. I try to convince him that baby will let us know when he's hungry and he only takes about 2 naps a day, usually about an hour or two sometime 3.   
What do I do? He's waking me up at 2:30 am to wake up the sleeping baby to feed him. He eats when I do but I'm afraid he's going to get stuck in this silly routine and never sleep through the night.   
Any and all advice welcome. Please. And thank you.",6
"Our 5.5 month son needs to be rocked to a deep sleep every night.  If he is not in a deep sleep he'll wake up the moment he's placed on the crib and starts howling.  Once alseep he sleeps well, sometimes through the entire night.  If he wakes up, which only happens if he has a very wet diaper, he needs to be rocked back to sleep again.  If he wakes up in the morning before we do, he's just fine hanging out in his crib.
We've heard the ferber method is very successful, but we believe it should be a last resort for our son.  We're looking for clear descriptions of alternative methods.  We want to help our little boy learn to go to sleep on his own.
-EDIT-
Thank you everyone for your advice.  It's great reddit has such a strong community of parents ready to help each other out :-).  We called the pediatrician today and they suggested we wait until 6 months for any type of sleep training.  She also said babies can go through a growth spurt at around 5.5 months so he could be waking up for hunger (and we do feed him when he wakes up).
They also had another option: 
1. Put him down when he is drowsy.  Sing him lullibyes and tell him how excited we are that he's going to try to sleep on his own.  
2. Give him 10 minutes and either stay in the room or leave.  At the end of 10 minutes comfort him by rubbing his back and picking him up if necessary. 
3. Repeat step 2 up to 3 times.  If he doesn't go to bed within the 30 minutes, rock him the old fashion way.  
4. If after a week this method doesn't work increase step 2 to 15 minutes",6
"Our almost 2-year old daughter has been favoring me for several months now, to the point that my husband is really starting to lose it.  Most nights, I can't make dinner unless I'm holding her (which is neither practical nor safe).  Hubby gets her ready for daycare in the morning while I'm getting ready for work.  If LO **sees** me in this process, she refuses to be with Daddy and screams and cries to the point of *shaking* until I come and get her.  If I manage to sequester myself out of her sight until we're all ready to leave for work/daycare, she's fine with him.  My husband is so upset by this; he loves her, wants to spend time with her snuggling while she eats her morning snack like they used to.  Some days, she even shies away from his touch after daycare, and gets upset if he tries to give her a hug and kiss.  We've tried a few suggestions from an article on Mommy Mania from whattoexpect.com, but none of them have worked.  I told hubs this morning that I wondered if it was more the fact that he was a man; daycare is all women.  He feels like he should be the exception because he's Daddy, not just any man.  I don't think a toddler's thought process is that sophisticated.

We've tried Mommy's busy""  nothing we're doing seems to be working.  We both have to work full-time she spends a lot of time in daycare.  I'm frustrated because it feels like the only way I can contribute to the household anymore is as a pacifier.  Hubs is frustrated because he feels like LO doesn't love him. Anyone else been through this?  What worked for you?  Thanks Mommit!""",6
"Our baby used to eat everything at 6 months - he would grunt if we didn't feed him fast enough. Now that hes picking more things up with his hands he's all of a sudden started to get really picky - cheerios and certain fruits are all he will eat. This has become so frustrating! I thought we were supposed to introduce new foods at this point, but every time I try any food he closes his eyes and shakes his head. I've even tried mixing pieces of other food with cheerios on his tray but he picks out the cheerios and leaves everything behind. He's a skinny but healthy baby still EBF so I know hes getting all the nutrients I'm just worried he's going to be a picky eater in the long run. Any advice/comments?",2

"Our daughter's schedule is like this.
Around 9pm, she gets sleepy and fussy so I breastfeed her so she has some food for the night and she is out cold 30 minutes after feeding. I transfer her over to her crib where she sleeps til about midnight (if not sooner) and wakes up wailing until I get her on the boob. 
I'm sure putting her right on the boob is going to (and has) conditioned her to expect the boob as soon as she stirs from any little sleep mode she's been in, so we try and pick her up and rock her to sleep with singing. This does work maybe 1 in 10 times and she'll be out again for another hour or two, but for the most part, she will get exponentially more hysterical if she isn't put to the boob.
I'm pretty sure she is waking up at night missing the breast and so she cries till she gets it. She doesn't seem to be hungry as she will suck for a minute and fall back to sleep. If we put her down before she is fully asleep, she will immediately wake and cry.
She's never had a period where she slept through the whole night like some lucky folks. I've read about getting the baby to sleep on her own, but we never were able to figure out how to do that. We have always had the problem of her getting hysterical if not on the breast so it has gradually gotten to this point of her waking very frequently at night.
We have changed her sleeping habits and she does not take naps in the afternoon, though she does sleep in the morning with multiple short naps, until about noon, which seems to be due to sleeping less at night. 
And just a heads up, we don't believe in the cry-it-out"" methods. I expect her to have a good amount of crying when we are changing her sleeping

"Our doctor suggested at our son's four month checkup that he can start on infant rice cereal before bed at any time. I spoke to a co-worker that said he decided not to feed his baby rice cereal because of recent studies that show high arsenic levels in this food.

If we help him roll over onto his tummy or place him on his tummy, he immediately starts to army crawl (he only does this in the crib) towards the other end and easily falls to sleep.

"Our nine month old gets four meals of solids a day, nurses fives times a day, and is a healthy 60% and 60% for height and weight.  But he takes at least an hour for every meal of solids each day.

He now has six teeth and gets purees when we're out and about but isn't any faster with them.

When he is finally done eating, he lets us know, it's not like he eats as much as we'll let him.  I expected this of an older kid who can talk or be more easily distracted, but at nine months all he does is eat slowly the whole time.  Anyone else have a kid like this?

"Our son has always been bad w/ meat ... We started him w/ meat as one of his first foods, pureed, and it's always been a struggle. If we want him to eat it, it HAS to be hidden in something else ... Usually potatoes, and even then he'll only take it half the time. We've done chicken, beef and pork ... Doesn't matter. Not a fan. We've increased the texture over time (as w/ the rest of his foods) and this also hasn't helped ... Putting chunks of it on his table to feed himself just results in meat on the floor for the dogs.  
So ... For now, i'm done fighting. I'm looking for alternatives ... 
He had scrambled egg and avocado for dinner last night, which seemed acceptable ... Beans and peanut butter are next on the list to try. What else is there? I'm having a hard time figuring out a vegetarian diet ... My husband and I are very 'meat and potatoes' kind of people.

"Our son, about 7 1/2, has always seemed to be near the ideal weight for his height.  Every once in a while he goes through a growth spurt and just before this he will eat more then usual and put on a small amount of weight. Then he grows into this. When he is not growing he seems to have little appetite.  It has always seemed like there is an amazing computer program controlling the growth and appetite process and everything has always worked out perfectly ... until now.A month or two ago he started eating more than ever before. He would ask for multiple extra meals and seemed to be genuinely hungry when he did.  He started being willing to try foods he would never have eaten previously.  We took this as a sign that he was preparing for a really big growth spurt.  But after this extended period of eating, his height hasn't changed much and he has put enough enough weight, at least near his stomach, that he says other kids are starting to call him fat. Yesterday we looked him up on the growth charts and found that his weight and BMI are at 90th percentile, which is alarming. (His height has always been around 75th percentile.) His activity level has also decreased.
I would have expected him to have this big appetite and put on significant extra weight as puberty approached, but this seems too early.  We have never before had any worries about his weight.  Of course we are trying not to say or do anything that would give him a complex.  Generally speaking the types of foods he eats are probably less junky than average. He's just been eating a lot.
I would be interested in hearing from any other parents who have gone through something similar or from people who can remember their own childhood patterns of growth and weight gain.",3

My daughter, who turns 9 tomorrow, for the past month or so has been completely over emotional and freaking out over every little thing. I don't mean normal back chat ect., like screaming and crying like a 3 year old. Right now, at this very moment, she is sitting at the kitchen table by herself, 5 minutes past her bedtime, screaming and crying because we are making her eat her dinner. She had a grilled chicken breast, a bit of veg, and 2 hash browns, so not a massive amount of food. She has been doing this over everything lately. I have no idea what to do, I'm at my wits end. We have tried everything. We talk to her about how she is feeling and what she feels would help her, that led to her trying to get away with things she knows she's not allowed to do, because she knew she wouldn't get into trouble the first time. We have tried grounding her repeatedly. At this point, as soon as she starts crying and freaking out I just tell her I am not going to argue with her, that's it, and walking away. If I engage her at all it just turns into a screaming match that never ends. Needless to say, my partner and I are completely at a loss and very frustrated. Any idea what could be going on with her?

"Parents of Reddit... I need your advice
My 28 year old (Single mother) sister's daughter just turned one years old and supposedly has never been able sleep through the night.  My sister is an archetypical Boulder, CO Hippie who had a natural birth, continues to mainly breast feed and still has her daughter sleep with her at night in the bed as she doesn't believe in making her sleep in a crib alone. Now, all of a sudden she wants to change to having her daughter sleep in a crib alone and is having absolutely no success.
I, her younger brother am a world away in NYC and want to do what I can to help.  She was supposedly told by a pediatrician that her daughter should be sleeping through the night and needs to acquire the services of a baby sleep consultant called [Compassionate Sleep Solutions](http://www.eileensclasses.com/).
Myself, always the skeptic immediately sees warning signs when someone who is not medically trained is offering their services for $350 for phone consultations... This screams snake oil salesman and is something I don't know if I feel comfortable contributing money towards.
However, I want to be a good brother and help my sister and niece attain peace at night.
Have any of you heard of or used something similar to help your children sleep?  It's not the money that is the issue, but moreover the idea of hiring a sleep consultant that bothers me.
Any thoughts?
**TL;DR  My sister's one year old cant sleep and wants to hire a sleep consultant.  Is this legitimate?**",6
"Please help me out.I have a 15 month old boy, and breastfeeding is going fine. My problem is with **disciplining him, and getting time for myself.** He does not like solids much, as he knows that he will get breast milk any time. But not having solids makes him hungry and cranky, and I cannot afford to have him at the breast all the time. I don‚Äôt wear him, as I have a bad back. 
He is very clingy, and he wakes up the moment I do, and needs to be carried around after that. Our mornings are a rush, so it is hard to get things done while carrying a big baby around. I pee, poo and brush while holding him and nursing him and that makes him slightly better while saving me time. But I need to cook and pack food too, and I can‚Äôt hold him when I do.
He goes to a daycare from 9 to 6, which is good for my sanity. But the moment I pick him up at 6 PM, he cries for boob, so I nurse him in the car. I suspect that fills him up, so he doesn‚Äôt want to eat dinner at all, gets angry and throws food around, till I give up n nurse him. But he nurses for ages, and sometimes he doesn‚Äôt fall asleep, so the half hour or one and a half hours I spent awake in bed doing nothing were a waste. 
 realized that I can‚Äôt have even a little bit of chocolate, or his sleep is affected. Coffee seems okay, the effects do not last as long as for chocolate. I need to throw out the granola bars that I bought without knowing they had chocolate ‚Äì it is too tempting to have it if it is in sight.
Sometimes I make him sleep and change my shirt, and put my old shirt near him. This way I can go finish my task without him waking up. I go in and periodically swap my shirt so that he can still smell me near him.
My questions:
**How do I make mealtime easier?** He eats well at the daycare.  Yesterday I drove back home from daycare without nursing him in the car, and he cried murder for a few minutes, and was fine. And we distracted him by taking him to the park afterward, so he was hungry enough at dinner time. I doubt we can take him to the park every day, especially with the crazy weather in my place.
1.	**How do I make nap times easier?** How can we get him to sleep if I am not around to nurse him? My family is pressuring me to stop breastfeeding since my life now revolves around nursing him, and also since by not sleep training him, I am inconveniencing the rest of my family who have to step in and help. He sleeps at the daycare, because the lady is kind enough to make him sleep on her shoulder, and she‚Äôs experienced enough to make it work. In the last two weeks she could transition him from her shoulder to her bed near her, but not to his nap mat. My family has not been able to do it.
3.He is basically clingy because my parents left a fortnight back, and he went nuts at home cause he was always surrounded by people and now there was only me. So he is still clingy and cries when I leave him at the daycare, and cries at home if I am doing something else. **How do Imake him feel more secure?**
4.	Unrelated to breastfeeding: The daycare provider mixes honey and lemons in his water, to make him drink more water. It is as sweet as lemonade. Should I ask her to dilute it further? I**‚Äôm concerned about him having sweets**, but thought honey is good since it is natural, but I‚Äôd like it to be in moderation too.
Update: since he came down with a fever on Friday evening, I've been nursing him kinda non stop and giving him lots of attention. He still is cranky in the morning (and through the night, thats a new problem but hopefully is temporary), but otherwise he's fine, and loving the attention. He even was comfortable to leave my side and go play in the daycare, when I left him. Usually he clings to my side and cries when I leave. I think the loads of attention did go him good for once. I'm going to incorporate all your suggestions in the future. Thanks!",6
"Please help! If this isn't the right sub please direct me where to go. I am at a loss and this is the first place I thought of. I used to frequent r/babybumps on a different account that I forgot my password to and I remembered hearing about this sub. I am a SAHM and this is my first baby. Let me start off by saying I didn't grow up around babies so I am making this up as I go. He is about 7 months old and I love having him around. I've read a lot of books and am trying my hardest.
When he first came to us he only slept about 1-2 hours at a time for the first 8 weeks and he had colic. I discovered the only thing that would soothe him was breastfeeding, and that still holds true today. Around 8 weeks he got a small cold and was congested so we started putting him in his swing at night to sleep or a bassinet type device called the Fischer Price Cruisin Soother which is a lot like a rock-n-play. He loved that thing and being angled and magically started doing a glorious 5 hour stretch of sleep at night. I talked to my pediatrician about it and he said it was fine. We think he may have had some acid reflux and that's why he likes the angle. Well he started sleeping in that full time. I would try and get him into the crib time and time again with no luck. Around 4-5 months we finally got him to sleep the whole night in the crib and he continues to do so, but he absolutely refuses to nap in it. 
When people meet him they remark how alert he is. He had huge eyes that are always opened wide and loves looking at everything and exploring the world around him. He is a very visually stimulated baby. When other babies would fall asleep he wouldn't. He is in his own room now with darkened curtains and a sound machine.
At night we have a routine. We change him into his PJs and sleep sack, read him a book, and then I rock him a little and sing to him, and BF him until he's very relaxed or sometimes he falls asleep. Then I put him into the crib which wakes him up even if he was asleep, but he can self sooth 95% of the time now and goes to sleep pretty quickly. He does pretty good at night now and only wakes up 1-2 times a night.
Naps are an entirely different story. We have our routine there too. I take him into the room sing to him, rock him, and BF him. I have been trying to get him into the crib for naps again. I have tried the Ferber Method with no luck. I have tried the pick up put down method but he just cries the whole time. If I try to put my hand on him to soothe him he will just try to play with it. I read Happy Sleep Habits, Healthy Child but If I leave him there for an hour he will NOT fall asleep 90% of the time. Now on the other hand if I let him fall asleep while BFing and then put him in the Cruisin Soother he will go asleep. He wakes up about half the time going down with that too, but he goes straight back to sleep most of the time.
How in the world do I get my child to nap in the crib? He is getting far to large for the soothin cruiser and I really want him to learn to self soothe. I know people say feeding to sleep is bad, but my plan is to feed him to soothe and then put him down drowsy. Happy Sleep Habits, Healthy Child says that BFing to soothe is totally fine.
Please help me! I am going crazy. I don't like him crying so much and my heart is breaking.",6
"Please I need your advise! My son is 1yr 5 months and he has been sleeping 17 hours! This is the third time he's done this and 2nd day in a row. He wakes up at 6:30am and we have breakfast and play and he usually gets sleepy around 10:30-11am so I put him down for a nap. He'll usually then sleep from 2-4 hours. But yesterday and today due to Holiday errands he's taken his nap after 1pm and slept through the night till the next day. Is this normal? I'm thinking he's just going through a growth spurt but not sure? I would really appreicate some input.
Thanks.
Update:
Thank you mommies for all your input and concerns. I was able to finally get a hold of the nurse (she's busy with flu season) and I voiced my concerns to her and she was very helpful. Pretty much as long as he's acting normal, eating well, and is communicating visually, vocally and physically there isn't much to worry about. She said at his age it's most likely a growth spurt. I'm still going to call my son's pediatrician Monday morning. My son woke up at 6am by hugging me and kicking my DH and signing eat and milk and he did devour his breakfast. We went to the park this morning and he had a blast. My DH and I are thinking we should put him down for his nap earlier to see if that helps him rest More since he's being more active.
Thank you again ladies.",6

So my wife and I have 2 children, one is 3.5 and the other is 18mos. Our 18 month old is developmentally delayed has many diagnosed conditions and others un-diagnosed. Some of the diagnosed conditions are eczema (covers most of his body) hypersensitivity, hypotonia, nystagmus, strabismus, multiple allergies and elevated liver function. At this point he is at a ~6mo level, he cannot sit well on his own, cannot eat solid food, cannot hold food or his bottle. He can army crawl a little though. We have had him to 2 pediatricians, 1 developmental pediatrician, neurology, ophthalmology, genetics and occupational therapy at childrens hospital. He has also been to duke university for genetics testing (which we do not have results back on yet) and gets speech and physical therapy from our states developmental program.
All of this is okay with us, we love him and we will do whatever we need to. Anyhow our problem is his screaming, headbanging and pulling out his hair. He screams for a minimum of an hour a day, sometimes up to 5 when he is on his belly he bang his head and will crawl to the hardest surface to do so. He bangs his head on his crib rails until his head is bloody and raw like this: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/HOF5b.jpg) he pulls his hair out of the back of his head and there is almost a bald spot. These actions get more prevalent the older he gets and he is rarely happy. All of this has my family stressed beyond belief. My wife and I are lucky to get a little time alone in the evening or a good nigts sleep. An example is last night, he was tired at ~6:30, he went into bed at 7, woke up 30 minutes later screaming and banging his head. He could not be calmed down. He finally went to sleep at 9pm, he woke at 3:45 and would not calm down. I ended up taking him for an hour car ride so he would not wake everyone else up. I got him home and put him in bed and he cried and banged his head for another 30 minutes until he fell asleep. Not one of the Dr's or therapists have any idea how to stop or help this, and I am not sure they believe the volume of it either. Its hard on our 3 yo too. We have in home day care but most of the time it is devoted to the 18 month old and our 3yo is left to play on his own or watch tv (which really bothers me). He does go to half day preschool 2 days a week, but I fear that the amount of tv and alone time is not good for him. I also fear this will break our family apart. My wife and I have been married for almost 8 years and had an amazing relationship until this screaming and self mutilation started, now we constantly fight about minor things because we are so stressed an overtired. Like I said earlier my wife would be more than happy to do anything for our kids and don't have any issues having a son who never develops, the problem is the screaming. HELP! ",6
"Please tell me everything will be OK. He was premature. Everything was normal at birth except for some breathing issues, but he was a HUGE premie for his gestational age. My pregnancy was ideal except that I gained more weight than they wanted. I'm talking close to textbook ideal. He stopped growing well at around 5 or 6 months old... like an ounce a month but his height was still chugging along. Recently his height stopped as well. Brain was still growing. He eats like crazy, is very active and hitting milestones but something was wrong. Blood work came back and his TSH level is elevated(hypothyroid apparently in babies it stunts growth) and I feel so alone/stupid. We're seeing a specialist but until then I just want to hear that it will be OK. That he isn't forever stunted or has a lower IQ because of this. That even though my gut told me something was wrong I just kept trying to change his diet instead of demanding blood work and possibly ruining him. †I knew in my gut something was wrong and because- except for weight- he was gaining the bare minimum I just went with the flow of trying more caloric solids.",6

Potty training my 2yo boy. I guess expecting poop on the floor is part of the territory. We've been on and off potty training since my other son was born...4 months ago. Just this week he's been going pee in his potty without me having to remind him. He gets a sticker and a jellybean after he goes. He's gone poop on the potty a couple times but there's a few incidents where a turd has fallen out of his pant leg. I guess he has trouble knowing if it's poop or a fart and can't get to the potty on time. So I've had to clean up a few turds off the floor this week. And I have to laugh cuz he noticed there was corn in it. Guess he needs to chew his food better too! He'll get the hang of it eventually right?!?!? Lol,6
"Previously posted on r/naturalremedies with no response.
I need an energy kickstart. I'm feeling run down and sluggish.
I know I'm doing a lot of things wrong right now, but a lot of it has to do with surviving life with a very active toddler. I'm still breastfeeding, and he nurses off and on at night still. I stay home with kiddo all day, then work in the evenings while hubby stays home. So there's a lot of energy going out, and probably a bit of sleep disturbance going on. These things I can't do much about.
Other things that are probably contributing...
1. I'm eating like crap. I had been losing a lot of weight through breastfeeding, to the point that I was looking pretty scary and my BMI was not good. But eating well with a toddler isn't always easy, as shopping, cooking, and sitting down to actually eat are all challenging when kiddo doesn't yet grasp the concept of wait."" So in order to just get food into my body regularly but I'm now craving those crappy foods. I used to eat super super healthy so this just disgusts me. 2. I eat too fast. If I take the time to prepare food kiddo is usually getting antsy by the time I'm actually sitting down to eat. So I inhale my food. Another learned behavior from when I was trying to stop the weight loss. Previously and all afternoon to finish lunch. But I would often end up throwing out a lot of food as it would dry out wilt or get nasty. So I started making myself eat faster. Bad. I end up feeling so gross after a meal like I've swallowed a brick. And since my body prefers to graze 3. Not taking any vitamins probiotics  taking the time to take my vitamins which was such a daily ritual for me during pregnancy and the first months after he was born has just become like ""one more thing"" that I can't cram into my day. And the more sluggish I feel 4. Not exercising. By now  you should not be surprised by this. I can barely rouse myself to brush my teeth and shower. so exercising? Meh. I played soccer until I got pregnant. I wouldn't last 10 minutes on the field now. I do active things with kiddo anything remotely challenging seems overwhelming. 5. No yoga meditation mind emotions and spirit are all very much connected. And I feel like my overall apathy is probably affecting all these areas. 6. No recharge time. I'm an introvert. Time alone recharges me. I'm never alone. I get maybe an hour after I get home from work when kiddo is asleep before he wakes up and wants to nurse. And honestly I'm usually doing whatever chore my husband didn't get to take care of while he was home with kiddo in the evening (tonight it's emptying cat litter for garbage collection tomorrow). I do have a 20 minute drive to and from work. And I usually put on a podcast to just numb my ears while I drive. But it doesn't feel rejuvenating. So dear internet friends... what would you recommend as a first step to improving my health & boosting my energy? I seriously need baby steps. What one thing can I change that will boost either my physical energy or emotional/mental/spiritual energy? I feel like if I could just get a little kickstart I also realize that this crazy toddler phase is only a short period of time in the grand scheme of things and my life will get better. But I feel I could be a better mom TL;DR - Wrung out mom is apathetic about self-care - feeling the consequences. Needs first step to get back on a healthy path.""",6

"Ready, set, rant...
15113,My mother babysat the LO (6 months old) over the weekend from Saturday morning into Sunday night. This is the second time. First time was fine (that we know of). 
15114,We have had multiple talks with her on what we do/don't want her to do and its not that long of a list since most things are common sense. That and shes obviously raised some children herself before so you'd think it would be okay.
15115,She however never listens to what i say. She either agrees for the moment and then ignores it later or tries to excuse her actions by explaining why she did X and then says 'you survived' as if this justifies it all. Acting oh so innocently as if shes been here before and so knows what to do better than I on everything.
15116,
15117,This weekend she went against orders by doing the following: having the baby sleep in the pack n play on her stomach (purposefully) throughout the night and with a blanket and toys in the crib, gave the baby yogurt (wtf half the family has a milk allergy) when told to give her nothing but her breast milk and some mashed carrots as shes just starting baby food this week -excuse was to get rid of her hiccups which I have repeatedly told her are normal and to just ride it out, decided on no naps so that all her friends at church and in the neighborhood that wanted to meet her could do so (because that would cut down on time to do this).
15118,
15119,She also thought it too hard to read the directions on how to put the pack n play together though we'd shown her a few hours prior how to in person for the 5th time, so decided not to put in two of the metal polls that hold up the netting for the mattress as she wasn't sure how (its a no brainer btw). The whole godamn thing could collapse! I freaked out needless to say.
15120,
15121,In addition she bleached! all her bottles after every use. When I told her that the bottles smelled like a pool when unloading her night bag she nonchalantly claimed she was just making sure they were clean. She does this with her own dishes. I told her for herself to consume it fine thats her gut, but this is My baby girl and under no circumstances should one be giving a baby of any type a toxic chemical. She went on to say dish washing detergent is also toxic to consume. Which I say, you know i use non toxic detergent then boil the bottles because you've seen me do it and obviously should know how i feel about these things, but i guess because detergent is okay to use bleach must be too? She had no answer other than, well you survived, and then moved on to another subject.
15122,
15123,My husband yelled at her for this (which he never ever yells about anything) and even said we don't need to explain ourselves on why you should or should not do X. We say what goes and thats that, before you do anything new call us. She then gives me a look that plainly says to me 'hes just a man and knows nothing'. Even though I had just said the same thing to her. This of course made me say i back him up 100% but i can already tell shes going to ignore this later on and claim she didn't realize she shouldn't do X. Rinse and repeat.
15124,
15125,In the end she just agreed with us and we moved on but I KNOW the next time she babysits this will happen again and I'm scared shitless. My mom doesn't say things like a snob or being mean. She says these things in a way thats all dumb innocence. I'm relatively sure she doesn't remember some things as shes always been this way so I write out simple instructions so theres no excuse. But then end up with the 'oh i forgot you gave me that sorry' reply.
15126,
15127,Next time she babysits over Memorial weekend we are telling her up front that if she does these things again she wont' be babysitting until our girl is old enough to take care of herself. I'm not sure what other approach to take. I'm so godamn angry that not only is she disrespecting our parenting and putting our baby in danger but shes ruining her chances of spending weekends with her Only granddaughter which will somehow end up making me feel guilty when we inevitably have to pull her privileges away no matter how good the reason. Shes the closest relative near us and the only grandmother thats physically capable of going places or taking care of her (other is handicap and wishes she could do these things im sure). I don't want to rob them the experience of being grandmother and granddaughter but she may force my hand. Its depressing.

Giving him some liquid porridge in a bottle calms him down, but I don't think he's waking because he's hungry (not crying, just wriggling), he's just a fat little knacker that will eat anything we give him.
Other half has recently started working 3 days a week, we think it may be related to that.

"She is a pretty normal, happy, healthy little girl. She is average in height but below average in weight. (18lbs still) and has been at that weight for quite awhile. No matter what me and my wife try she will not eat anything other than snacks. Anything we try to give her gets thrown on the floor. When she was younger 1 tried a couple times to force feed her (nothing overly aggressive just not letting her go) but even that really didn't work.
We've tried making food fun but still no interest. I keep getting told that When she is hungry she will eat"" but it hasn't happened yet. Only thing I can think of is fully cutting off snack time so that she will eat meals but that seems counter productive. One of the things she will almost always eat are French fries so we have been doing that more than I like but she isn't getting much nutrition out of those. We do supplement with a multi vitamin but I would really like her to get eating normally.""",2
"She is obviously still a 2-nap baby, although I know that will change soon. But everything I have read says they drop the morning nap, and no babies drop the afternoon one. She generally wakes up around 7:30-8am, then takes her first nap around 10:30 (sometimes 11 if we do the library or swim lessons). She has never refused the morning nap and goes to sleep just fine at night (7:30pm is bedtime).
But in the past 3 weeks, she has probably only taken her afternoon nap about 2-3 times a week. I started experimenting with the timing last week. I thought I had figured it out--exactly 2 hours after waking from the morning nap. But NOPE, that didn't work yesterday or today. When I put her down for it, she generally just plays in her crib for an hour, and then starts crying. Yesterday she was a total fussy-butt all afternoon and through dinner because of being overtired. On days we go to the gym, she does fine at the childcare no matter if she got a nap or not.
Has this happened to anyone else? Help please?

"She says he's a picky eater and that she's tried years ago to get him to eat and he ended up not eating anything for says so she stopped.
My thought is that he's a picky eater because he's allowed to be and granted he certainly does have things he should not like eating but he doesn't eat hardly anything at all. And when he does eat, it's usually in front or within sight of the tv or computer so instead of eating he zones out on the entertainment instead of eating.
So, my system is that at 6 he should for the most part, be eating what we are. So he's to eat what we make, and at the dinner table, with nothing else to do but eat, and eat the meal in a half hour.
My girlfriend is sure he'll just starve and that this won't work but she's on board to try.
Can I get some input from other parents? I know it'd help her to get other opinions and perspectives too.",2
"She was sleeping in the crib from day 1, waking up every 3-4 hours to eat. Then suddenly, at about 6 - 6.5 months, she started to wake up more often. At first we thought it was hunger, but now she wakes up every hour - hour and a half, and it's not hunger, because we can go to the crib (next to our bed) and just grab her gently and rock her, and in 5 minutes she'll be sleeping again. Sure she gets her night snack, she gets the tit every 3-4 hours, but still she continues to wake up so often, and all she needs is a bit of rocking to go back to sleep. 
She eats solids appropriate for her age, mixed with breastfeeding (one meal breast, one meal solid, and so on - except at night). No cramps, two of the teeth are out (bottom ones) with no visible white lines of another teeth ready to poke out (at least at this time). Only thing she has different is more common poops. No diarrhea, just poops often, she uses like 10 diapers per day (not counting the night). Everything else seems ok.
She's exhausting both me and my wife, it's impossible to get any rest at night, and even if I went to another room (since I work and she's at home), that wouldn't solve the problem - she's exhausted too.
Any ideas why is our baby girl acting like that and what could/should we do? We tried once to let her cry it out, but it got us even more screaming and she would wake up completely, so putting her back to sleep was even harder then - so we gave up on that method.",6
"She's been a really good sleeper since she was about five months old. Just recently (in the past week) she's been waking up multiple times a night.
Her bedtime is 8pm and she would sleep good until about 11. She woke up, got her butt changed and a new bottle and she would be back down until about 8am. That's been pretty standard for her for almost a year. 
But now, after 11pm, she's up close to every two to three hours. At first I thought she wasn't eating enough at dinner. (She's never eaten a whole bunch in one sitting and I read that if you force a child to eat when they push the spoon away, you could set them up for unhealthy eating habits later in life, so I never pushed it.) I tried making her something a little more hearty the next night thinking that would solve the problem. It didn't. I've tried turning up the heat in her bedroom (It's getting pretty chilly where I live) and keeping her up an extra hour at night to tire her out. Nothing is helping. 
I don't know what to do to help her sleep through the night. Should I begin putting cereal back in her bottle again? Try co-sleeping? Maybe switching to a sippy cup at bedtime? Help! I'm sleepy.

"Since cutting out grains and sugar, I've noticed a 50% decrease in the amount of milk I'm able to pump. I'm still getting a lot of protein, fat, and vitamins/minerals (I eat a lot of fruit and veg, in addition to taking iron, pre-natal, B complex, calcium and D supplements).
I've cut out grains and sugar because it's the only way I can lose weight without feeling hungry. I tried re-introducing whole grains once a day (quinoa, brown rice, bulgur) but I felt sluggish and gained weight. I'm also not allowed to go on a conventional calorie-restricted/low-fat diet per my doctor (she said grain free/sugar free is fine). I do a lot of walking and run several times a week. However, my baby is 8 months old and I'm still 40+ pounds over my pregnancy weight, and I'm getting really cranky and tired of being in this body. 

Here is my typical daily diet -- can anyone spot anything wrong?
Breakfast: 2% or whole fat Greek yogurt or egg/sausage muffins with a banana or grapefruit plus black or green tea (if black tea, with cream)
Snack: A couple handfuls of almonds
Lunch: Tuna salad on spinach
Snack: Generally an apple with cheddar cheese, almonds, or 2 oranges plus black or green tea
Dinner: 1/2 a steak, a chicken breast, or a pork chop with oven-roasted potatoes and steamed or saut√©ed vegetables
Dessert: Apple or grapefruit

"So  I got my then gf pregnant Anyway  we're out here visiting my grandparents The incident that prompted me to write this happened earlier this evening. I was in the bedroom (on reddit of course)  my wife and daughter in the kitchen From the way my wife tells it  this is my understanding:
My daughter was eating cereal and milk (she's a picky eater)  and started eating with her hands.  My wife and I practice fairly patient parenting.  So my wife starts the usual routine; explains why we don't eat this food with our hands But my dad  he steps in I get a text and walk in there  and just from the body language I know somethings up.  I play it nice.  Address my daughter in a loving tone  ""She's a child  she doesn't know how the world works.""  Basically defending her for being a two year old and making a mess. Oh lord. I have not the words. It was perfect.  that nuclear bomb in my head I clean up my daughter and then we leave my dad in the kitchen alone. Back in the bedroom my wife tells me the whole story.   My gut reaction  trying to remain calm and not confront my dad (I have to work really hard controlling my temper) So my question for you  parents of reddit Our plan right now is to act like everything's fine  but then tomorrow after we've gone to my grandparents Even after having a few hours to cool down  I don't want him having anything to do with my daughter.  I know that's harsh",6
"So at this point I think my kid has actually become a worse sleeper as time has passed.  Bedtime is terrible.  He's never sleepy.  Despite a very consistent routine.  He's usually awake for 30-60 minutes, rolling around, sometimes crying/yelling.  And over the past couple of weeks he's woken up screaming and will only go back to sleep after being up, on average twice per night.  
I've done some searching and I'm confused about some things.  At what point do you stop giving them a bedtime bottle/sippy cup?  I don't understand, if dinner (however much he decided to eat or not eat) plus the bedtime milk aren't enough to get him through an entire 12 hours, how/when does it make sense to take away the bedtime milk?  Do you just accept that he's possibly going hungry and ignore it, hoping that he'll eventually learn to eat more during the day?  
Am I trying to do this too early?  Or did everyone else stop putting their kids to bed with milk at, like, 12 months and I just never knew it? Anyone?",6
"so far I have been called a bad mother because:
*I make my kids eat their veggies (another mother actually called me a bad mom for this)
* as long as their clothes fit, are clean and weather appropriate, I let them wear what they want.  if this means going to Wal-Mart in a cinderella costume with an iron man mask, so be it. (but apparently I should have my kids taken away)
* using a leash on my kid when she was going through the phase of ripping her hand away from mine to go run through traffic.  people may judge me, but guess what? she's alive and well today with no psychological damage.

"So first off sorry if this isn't the most appropriate subreddit.

Anyway, here's the story: we're about two weeks out from our first child, a baby girl. Two months ago my wife was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. She had to go a strict low-carb diet to keep her blood sugar at the right level, and she handled it like a champ.

But after the latest ultrasound, we learned that the baby is measuring about a week too big, especially in the abdomen. She's already 8 pounds so she could be 9 or 10 by the time she comes.
My wife is now kinda freaked out afraid that she made her fat"" (my wife's a bit overweight herself) Anyone have any insight to share on any of these things? Any other mom's have gestational diabetes or just plain fat/big babies and care to share any wisdom? Anything you can share might help ease our minds. Thanks! **EDIT: Thanks everyone for the insights. I think it's put our minds at ease  for as much as first-time-parents-to-be can be at ease. :)**""",6
"So first things first, I love my husband dearly and feel guilty even writing this because I feel like I am bitching about him but in actual fact just need advice right now. 
Our situation is that we have been married for 3 years, live with his parents for the time being while we are saving to renovate our home. They are lovely people and care for me as if I am their own child, the feelings are mutual. We have an 18 month old daughter and we both love her more than life itself. 
I am starting to realise how unprepared he was/still is to be a father and it is sadly distancing me from him emotionally. He assured me he was ready and I truly believe he thought he was. He's never been overly involved in her care as he comes from a very 'traditional' household where the woman basically does EVERYTHING including all child raising although he was always typically anti-tradition in that regard and went against the grain so far as to criticise it so I honestly thought things would be different. 
Shit basically hit the fan today when I got up to go to work (I work weekends, he doesn't). I got up earlier than usual to our daughter, organised her, the housework and myself before work so that he could have a bit of a sleep in as he has had a few early shifts this week. I repeatedly told him about a doctor's appointment I'd made for the baby straight after work and told him he would need to bring her and I'd meet him there. He forgot about the appointment hours later and I had to call him to rush there immediately, he arrived without any supplies for her, no nappies, no milk, no food, no warm clothes ... NOTHING. She started screaming for milk and it didn't end until we got home. When I came home, our bedroom (the only room we have to live in) was trashed, bed unmade, clothes and toys everywhere, dirty glasses and cups, dirty milk bottles. I still can't bear to look at him right now and I will admit, he disgusts me right now. 
I will mention that I have a few chronic health conditions, one serious that make it very difficult to maintain a job AND do everything else on my own but I try my best and my husband DOES try to understand. A week prior to this incident, I was feeling very unwell with vomiting etc and had to stay in bed for the morning, I asked my husband to get up to the baby which he gladly did. I decided I should get up (it was about 12pm by that time) and when I walked into the living room I discovered dirty dishes, dirty bottles, the house was like a bomb site, the baby had not been fed AT ALL since 7pm the previous night because she didn't seem hungry and wasn't saying she was hungry"" and had not been changed for many What angers me the most is that he will get his mother to feed her change her Please tell me  and please be truthful ... Is my growing resentment justified? I honestly feel like I've married a child. EDIT: Thanks everyone for your replies. It's much appreciated.""",6
So got to take a trip to the ER tonight. Daughter (month and a half) was making weird gasping nosies like she had something in her throat. Doctor checked her out and everything was good. But now I'm thinking maybe a food allergy? I had fish for dinner last night and now she has a painful diaper rash. Any other moms have any experience with this? PS baby is breastfed,6
"So having read Dr. Sears' baby book, and read up on the benefits of breastfeeding, babywearing, etc., I had my kid and they actually let me take him home from the hospital. I, who have little experience with newborns. 
I try and cuddle as much as he wants, feed on cue, basically I try to fill his needs before he starts crying. I only succeed about 50% of the time, but 95% of the time I get him before he enters full-scale upset. This takes up my entire day, as he is 1 month old. 
The question is this: am I setting us both up for failure? Hell, he won't even let me set him down long enough to go pee, much less make a sandwich, etc. I need him to learn that I have to set him down occasionally. I have tried the Boba wrap and an Ergo carrier, and he dislikes them both because he can't see forward yet (can't support his head yet). I'm making a sling tomorrow after I get the right size rings. 
My husband and neighbor both think I need to let him fuss more before picking him up-I do get over to him more or less immediately unless he's asleep, as sometimes he'll go back to sleep in a few seconds if not disturbed. Are they right? Am I just setting myself up a headache?"" Or am I just doin' it wrong? Any help is appreciated. Thanks!""",6
"So he does amazing with naps (FINALLY!!!). He will go down at 9:30 and sleep until 11:00-11:30 and then again at 2:00 until 4. At night we have an established bed time and he's in his crib by 7:30-8. He will fall asleep no problem, doesn't even cry. Then comes his first wake up. I get him and feed him then try to put him in his crib and all hell breaks out. He cries, hard. It's his frustrated cry not his pain cry so I know everything is okay. He just won't stop. He will cry for 30 minutes until he maybe starts to calm down. I don't understand why this is happening. He use to be so good at night. Granted he would wake up four times but I never had an issue with him going back down in his crib. Has anyone had an issue like this?

"So here I am....a little over 4 months postpartum (first time mom) and I've lost over 50lbs. True I'm a far cry from looking like what I did before my little man but I'm pleased with my progress. I'm starting to see old familiar friends......my cheekbones (hey I thought you had moved out of my face), my jawline, my collarbone, quad muscles. Again not where I ultimately want to be but it gave me a little boost to recognize the old me"" coming back into focus. Cue friends Lets start with one of my best friends who I haven't seen in over month - she'll notice right? Well she comes over to hang out - no comments but oh well but then we're talking about an upcoming concert we're going to together (my first real girls night out since baby) and she's asking me about what I'm going to wear. I tell her I'm not sure because I haven't really unpacked a lot of my old clothes and she says not to worry because everyone's body reacts differently to pregnancy and ill lose the weight....but I look fine for someone who just had a baby. I mean I know she probably didnt think anything of it and definitely didnt mean to hurt my feelings but.....yep hurt my feelings. Here I thought I had lost a fair amount of weight but ugh. The concert is Friday but I'm feeling like I want bail already. Okay how my SO...clearly he'll at least acknowledge my weight loss. Again not so much. After seeing my friend †I thought I would start going through some my old clothes to see what fits and sadly most do not fit to the point I can wear them. I'm feeling a little bummed and try to talk to him about y still small wardrobe and his response is † well you were thin before the baby....but it's not a big deal. Really?! That's all. I wait for more but nope that's his comment. I tell him well it is a big deal to me - that it has been hard for me Family is coming over.....maybe one of them will say something. You get where this is going....I know this isn't the end of the world but it just plain sucks †took the wind out of my sails. Under any other circumstances †I think a 50lb+ weight loss would warrant some positive feedback but since its pregnancy weight....since I don't look exactly like I did before I guess means I just need more time?

"So here¬¥s the problem; One of my twins is extremely active and loves to move as much as possible but has a hard time eating, I guess it is just too boring for him.

"So he's been struggling with this for a few years now.  Flighty, forgetful, spaces out, social norms are nonexistant, etc...
He was living with his mother and she did an absolutely terrible job raising him (long story short, he'd get out of school, go to the Boys and Girls club for 4 hours, then grandma would pick him up until she got home 3 hours after that).  He was struggling in school and at home with very simple things.
He came to live with me in 3rd grade, we had some issues the first few months but he started to cope well and do better in school.  He still had some issues, but not nearly as pronounced.
FF to 4th grade.  He's all over the place again (every time he goes to his mothers he comes back worse than he left).  He struggles even more so, I'm guessing it's just more pronounced due to the learning curve in 4th grade being much steeper than 3rd.  Parent teacher conference rolls around.  He's fallling behind, at this rate he'll fail 4th grade.  I do everything I can with him.  Study for hours, guide him, keep him focused, talk to him, everything.  When it comes time for him to do things by himself, he just. can't. focus.  
His teacher mentioned that he might have Aspergers, I freaked out a bit.  Took him to see a child psychiatrist, he took some tests, talked to her a few times, etc... She reassured me that he didn't have Aspergers or Autism (which his mother told me that he had been officially diagnosed with Autism, though never did anything about it).  I told her (the psych.) that I am not all about medicating my child but he needs help.  She prescribed him Concerta, a strict diet (to counteract the weightloss sideeffect), weekly educational counseling and monitoring his bloodwork and mental behaviors.  
I'm relieved that it's not something serious and now knowing what it is, being able to give him the help he needs to stay on target to graduate and keep up with his class.  He is incredibly smart when it comes to math but can't focus long enough to finish a sentance (not parental bias, his test scores for the STAR exam have him in the 98%ile for math but 65%ile for writing).
My question to you, Reddit parents, what advice do you have on dealing with the frustrations and routine of a child with ADHD?",6
"So I am kind of pissed at myself for not realizing this sooner.  I recently started a partial raw vegan diet for myself, and I've been making a ton of smoothies.  
At the same time, my two year old boy/girl twins are pretty much refusing to eat 80% of the vegetables and fruits (and everything else) we give them.  My boy eats a lot of fruit, but no veggies.  My girl hates most fruit but loves broccoli.  They are very different in what they decide to eat.  they decided to try it!
So a few weeks ago I decided to let them try one of my smoothies.  I let them watch me make it, and I just told them it was juice"" And the verdict is...they LOVE it.  They suck these down so fast that they are asking for more 5 minutes later.  It's amazing.  They get all their daily amount of veggies and fruits in 5 minutes every day.  One less thing to worry about!"" ",2
"So I am very lucky that my 19 month old loves vegetables BUT he hates meats. There are very few meats that I can get him to actually eat. He'll eat shrimp poppers and tilapia with no problem, and chicken or meatloaf some days he likes it and some days he doesn't. If it's roast beef or pork he will have nothing to do with it. I know he's getting lots of good stuff out of the veggies but I know that meats are important too. 
So my questions are: What are some ways I could possibly get him to eat meats? What are other things I could give him instead of meats? Should I even be worried about this? I'm sorry if this sounds stupid. I'm a first time mom and I just want to make sure my son is happy and healthy, which I'm sure a lot of you parents feel the same way.

"So I know this isn't parenting"" per se I'm 27 and married.  My niece had some trouble picking a school  but when she finally decided My parents (her grandparents) made a deal with her that they would help her pay for tuition by matching whatever she earns.  Tuition is in-state  so she only needs to make a few thousand each semester. Here's the problem: my wife got her a job at a local restaurant that is run by one of our friends.  The deal would be to start as a hostess (minimum wage) and move up to a server ($25-30/hour).  She has been here since the end of August   but she is still hosting.  Our friend has offhandedly mentioned that our niece hasn't been taking the job very seriously and it seems to me that she is far more focused on sports and friends than earning what she needs to in order to afford her tuition this semester.  She has only been working 1-2 days per week and they have only been weekdays. Should I say something? Part of me thinks I shouldn't say anything until push comes to shove since I'm not her parent  but on the other hand Please help... Any advice would be appreciated. **UPDATE**:  My wife's friend called my wife last night to let her know that my niece is going to be fired on Wednesday.  She was scheduled to work on Friday and Saturday with a staff meeting on Sunday morning.  On Friday  she tried to call in an hour before her shift to go volunteer at a school event.  Our friend told her that she couldn't call in this late without finding a replacement Looks like we'll have to figure out whether or not to kick her out when she can't pay her tuition.

"So I posted last week that my 6mo son has been coughing a lot since he started solids. Well, we stopped food for a few days, kept him on an incline, and he got better, we gave him breakfast this morning and he's coughing again, and a lot worse than before. So I'm pretty positive it's a swallowing disorder. 
We're seeing the doctor next week, who I'm sure will send us to a specialist. I'm in tears over here though, because he sounds terrible. He doesn't seem to be too effected by it, he's still a sweet happy guy. Does anyone know of a way to help clear his throat, other than liquids? He doesn't like bottles much so if he gets a really bad cough going that won't stop I just stick him on the boob, but he still will only eat laying on his side and sometimes that even makes him cough right now. I'm a SAHM thank god so I can watch him constantly and monitor his coughing but I'm a mess. I'm so worried. We're definitely not going to feed him any real food until we know how to prevent the coughing but any advice you guys have is much much much appreciated. edited for spelling.",6
So I was sick to my stomach last Wednesday and our day of excessive spit up could be that he caught what ever bothered me. We also tried bananna for the first time yesterday. He seemed extra farty yesterday and didn't want his carrots at dinner which he usually eats great. He didn't really poop yesterday but had a very watery bm. Today he has been gassy and spitting up a lot. His mood has been okay just lots of spit up. No poop at all today. Maybe the bananna didn't sit well? Anyways so if your baby is spitting up a lot and you are in your first month of solids. Would you recommend skipping a night and just doing breastmilk? Should we do just plain cereal with no veggies tonight? I know we won't be eating any bananna just in case that new food is the culprit. Wondering what you more experienced mommas think.,2
"So I'll start off by saying that I'm reluctant to post here, as a lot of mommits have given me flak for being a young/unwed mom, formula-feeding, and many other things that are no one's business; but I need help, so I'm back. 
My five-month-old daughter used to be a great sleeper until she hit that magical four-month mark.I used to be able to put her to bed completely awake and she'd fall asleep on her own, waking up once to eat. When she hit 4 months, she started waking up to be held, because she wanted the paci, and other unnecessary things.
Since her bad sleep habits have gotten so out of control, my fiancee and I have decided to sleep train her, and we're looking at the Ferber method. There have been a handful of instances where she's had to cry herself to sleep for naptimes and it seems to work really well for her.
So here are my questions:
* She snacks during the night sometimes. I'm talking a three-ounce feed at most once a night. Should I try to wean her from that first or is it ok to ignore it?
* Is five months old an ok age for this kind of sleep training?
* And lastly, I'm looking for feedback and experiences from women who have tried and/or succeeded to sleep train their child(ren). So share away. :)

"So I'm separated from my wife, pending divorce. I see my kids Friday evening to Sunday evening (3 dinners) and also on Wednesdays (overnight for the summer, dinner out all together the rest of the time). I'm new to this lifestyle, and trying to find my feet in various ways. Between now and Xmas, I'm doing the following:
August 6-10th - holiday with the kids and my parents
August 10th-12th (w/e) - Away at a music festival, parents looking after the kids
August 17th-19th (w/e)- Stag do
September 30th-2nd (w/e) - Trip abroad with friends
November 30th-1st (w.e) - Possible music festival
Given that every weekend I'm spending *all* my spare time with my children, and working hard to find fun new things to do every day I'm with them (planning a few weekends camping soon etc.) my wife is outright accusing me of being a bad parent for having the audacity to not have them EVERY weekend without fail. She said that maybe 1 weekend a year was acceptable, very possibly 2 if there was an unavoidable event (like this stag do is). She maintains that me not seeing them once every two months for the rest of the year with devastate them, and they will begin to resent me as I continue to disappoint them, and show to them the person I really am. That really is the kind of language she uses. Unsurprisingly I don't really agree with this. She refuses to do anything on a weekday evening when she has them (despite the fact that she is very welcome to and I would be more than happy to babysit at her house as and when this happens) and as such believes that I should turn down all offers from my dearest friends to do anything on the weekend.

"So I've been googling and looking up ideas for how to handle my four-year old's current whining trend, but none of them seem to fit the situation very well. My son knows pretty well not to whine FOR something. He doesn't usually phrase it in a whine when he asks for food, tv, games, etc. He went through a phase like that, but after being told No
Now however  many of these things are NOT something you should be whining about. Ingrate. The longer it goes on the more escalated things get as I get more and more frustrated at his tone as the day wears on. And my 4.5 year old still takes good naps every day even  but it persists. Friends have suggested having a reward system in place  some sort of incentive for him not to whine  but I feel like it's just dressing up bribery to try to elicit behavior from him he really already knows I expect. He shouldn't get to expect toys for not being bratty  right? I don't know. What does reddit think?

Everyone thinks I should just be happy to provide well for my baby. now for the venting!. I Have an over supply issue... Like Way over supply this is my second kid , and the second time I have chosen to 100% breast pump. First kid didn't know how to root, latch or suck , second kid had a bad latch and bit me so badly. So I resorted to pumping because it worked well with the first.. With first kid I peeked out at 90 oz / day spread across 5 pumpings .... And no even at 5 pumpings I didn't have trouble with keeping supply up around 90. But that is 9 oz / side per pumping session.... This time I wanted to start decreasing and I have been spreading the pumpings out but the supply isn't going down ... I'm only pumping 3 times a day 5:30, 1:30, 9:30 and I'm going to exploded. ( I have tried most of the weaning tricks and even some of the Whoo-Whoo advice I can find ) this morning I pulled down 34oz.... that is more than I need to feed my son for an entire day . My boobs feel like Hot water balloons not to mention the weight... a 36K weighs approx 5lb / boob . the milk is adding or removing a whole pound per side. Its messing with my balance. Lets not even mention how difficult it is to stay hydrated... if your taking out 100oz / day then you have to put that in ... I have to drink 200oz / day just to not get a head ache. that is 12 oz / hr every hour I'm awake I'm so sick of the taste of water! I'm currently paying for carbonated water with flavoring added to change it up. My boobs are actively changing multiple cup sizes in one day . they are a 36 K when not filled with milk... I feel like my boobs precede me into any room and they are half my depth and I also feel like they are the only thing people see as they visually change size during the work day. my son is almost 4 months old and a saint... but why the oversupply. I know that undersupply can be difficult to deal with but I needed to vent, oversupply can be just as painful and difficult to deal with as well.†",6
"So like the title says I posted this on /r/CBTB2 but we're mostly new new moms over there and I think you ladies are a little more experienced and might have a little more insight. I don't know if I ever intro'ed here so if not here's [my intro from /r/CBTB2](http://www.reddit.com/r/CBTB2/comments/2zpvrh/hi_intro_possible_triggers/) Okay so a few things have been going on this weekend. Renley turned a month old yesterday, yay! All night and today it's like he can't get enough to eat. Formula fed, and fed of demand but it's like the kid is always hungry! (currently 4oz but that never seems to be enough). I know some moms that use cereal this early but I'm not sure I want to try it just yet. How did your little one feed around this time? He'll also fall asleep with the bottle in his mouth and no matter how deep of a sleep he's in if you take it away he immediately wakes up and wants it back, but it has to be the bottle cause he'll refuse the pacifier even if the bottle is empty. I don't ever let him suck the empty bottle because I don't want him taking in air like that. He's also been extra fussy lately no matter what. He can be fed, burped, changed, but he'll still cry unless he's held. It's a backwards step from where we were because just the other night he did great eating, burp, change, in the crib and slept for up to 5 hours at a time with one small stint of letting him CIO. Last night he fell asleep on me while we were watching GoT and slept till about 12. After our usual routine it took an hour and a half to get him back to sleep and he slept till about 5 and after the routine again all he did was cry and scream till we picked him up. My boyfriend got up at like 6 to give me a break from trying to get him asleep but had to leave for work around 7. He ended up in bed with me at 730ish because I couldn't take the crying anymore and I still had to rock him to sleep because if I stopped moving he cried. I don't know where that habit came from because I don't rock him if I can help it and neither does my boyfriend. He's never out of my sight so I know others don't do it because I tell them not to. I don't know what's going on with him. On top of all that poor thing also has a bad rash I've been trying to treat. It's like his poor little butt cheeks are chafed and the butt paste stuff isn't working so I've been using powder, which seems to be doing alright. I just feel like a failure mother because he's been so irritable and fussy and it's like nothing I do can help and I'm exhausted and equally irritable sometimes and I just feel helpless.",6
"So me and my girlfriend just had our first child (a baby boy) on the 31st. We decided that he should be breastfed, but we're having a little bit of trouble with it, and I was hoping maybe some other breastfeeding parents on here could give us some tips, or some stories on how to make this easier for him and for us.
The only main problem we're having with him right now is that he is cluster-feeding. He'll eat for 10-15 minutes on one breast, then refuse the nipple and fall asleep. The problem is that he'll wake up 30 minutes to 1 1/2 hours later and want to feed again. From what I've read, he should be eating about 2 oz, every 2-3 hours. It's making it very difficult for either of us to sleep at night.
That was my only real concern with him right now. After we left the hospital I went out and bought a breastpump and Tommee Tippee bottles, with the nipples for newborns and my girlfriend has been pumping about 6-9 oz. a day for him to eat. He hasn't had any problem eating 2-3 oz per feeding from the bottle, but he'll still wake up in ~2 hours hungry again.
Sorry for the wall of text.
Tl;Dr: newborn is clusterfeeding and we're not able to get a a lot of sleep.
Edit; Heres a picture of me and the little guy

"So my 1 year old girl just decided that she was going to change her sleep schedule (which was luxurious. she was sleeping through the night from around 6 to 11 months) And now she wakes up every few hours to eat. We've tried everything to try and put her back down without eating, but nothing works. We've also noticed she isn't eating as much during the day (we're trying to get her to eat more solid foods, as well as baby foods. ) but she just spits it out, and as she is still hungry, she continues to whine because she wants her bottle. Well, it's time to ditch the bottle as her poop gets super yucky when she has too much milk, and as far as I'm aware she should be getting a lot of her food from non liquid foods at this age.
19354,
19355,So if anyone has any tips to get a 1 year old to eat more (enjoying it also would be a plus) please let me know. I'm also guessing that perhaps this also has to do with weening a kid off of milk so anyone with experience involving this subject I would be happy to hear from. Sleeping at least 5 hours a night again would be nice considering I work two jobs and am slowly becoming unhinged from reality :) ",1
"So my 20 month old happens to have a potty already in the bathroom. Last night, after dinner he pooped like usual. But this time he told his dad I poopoo."" As he was doing it. So I thought maybe we can try. So this morning after breakfast  I thought we'd try it out. Lo and behold he peed on the potty! And has peed on the potty 5 times already today. He'll tell me he has to pee and run to his potty. I didn't mean for potty training to take full effect so soon and I in no way want to pressure him into doing it. But he seems to really want to do it. I've read training too early despite the child's readiness usually has negative outcomes. What are your experiences with potty training? I don't think I can stop it now",6
"So my 21 month old daughter came down with a really nasty stomach bug yesterday afternoon, where she was puking every 15 minutes for about 6 hours, not able to keep even a small sip of water down.  Her doctor recommended that she go to the ER, so we brought her in and they gave her some zofran.  She finally was able to drink some water and slept through the night, without vomiting!  She didn't seem interested in food this morning, but she happily drank some pedialyte.  She had about 3 saltines this afternoon around 4p, but refused toast and applesauce around 630p.  Again, she gladly drank pedialyte and water, so she is staying relatively hydrated (and she didn't vomit at all today).  Is this pretty normal as far as toddler illness goes?  I am concerned about her not getting enough nutrients, but I also didn't want to push her to eat if she didn't feel up to it.  Am I supposed to stick to the BRAT diet or should I let her eat normally?  Should I be concerned that she hasn't eaten anything other than a few crackers today?",6
"So my 3 1/2 year old, for the last couple weeks, has been asking for multiple snacks in the half hour before bedtime. She tells me she is hungry, but it doesn't seem to matter how much she has eaten for dinner or what time. I'm not sure if she is just trying to stall bedtime, just wants food and isn't really hungry, or actually needs it? I have just been giving her a reasonably healthy snack (some yogurt, a graham cracker, a slice of wheat bread) but my entire family is overweight and I was my entire childhood and it caused so many problems for me, I'm desperate to avoid making the same mistakes my parents did. I know there is a fine line between keeping girls healthy and giving them complexes... should I trust her when she says she is hungry and keep giving her a healthy snack before bed, or should I pick a time and cut her off?",2
"So my 4 year old is very head strong.  She has a very hard time listening. I've tried everything I can think of. Tonight, for example, we went to my Aunt and Uncle's Vow Renewal and 25th Wedding Anniversary Party. I tried getting her to take a nap today, she flat out refused for 3 hours, which at that point, it was time to go. We get to the party, and she immediately starts running around, not listening. I got her fed, and surprisingly she sat long enough to do that. I ended up having to take her in the bathroom twice for talks. When we went outside to get some fresh air, she wouldn't stay out of an opened gate. Later on, she say down to eat some cake, I ended up having to go on a coloring book run, so I could keep my almost 2 year old seated for a while. That held my 4 year olds interest for about 5 minutes, MAYBE 10, but that's a stretch. She was doing fine with karaoke later. We were sating out goodbyes, and she ran off..again. My mom ended up getting her, and the whole time she was carrying her to the door, she was screaming Let me go!!"" repeatedly. They took balloons home from the party  that she was walking the rest of the way home (with my mom  I was going to drive about half a block away to the gas station  they were just going to meet me there  so she wasn't walking all the way home). The restaurant was still open  so I ended up getting out of the car with her  because she refused to get out I made her sit on the curb while I talked to her. I wouldn't let her get back in the car until she stopped crying and screaming. I just don't know what to do anymore. Any advice is welcome!!""",6
"So my boy had his two month appointment last Monday, 2/10, and got shots.  Since then he has not slept well during the day, but sleeps great at night.  Prior to his appointment, he was taking two three hour naps a day with a cat nap after those around dinner time and then would be put to bed about 730.  In between all these naps, he was a happy baby and could smile and coo and would be happy playing on his playmat for lengthy periods.  On Valentine's day, he started with this horrible, something hurts cry and would not sleep but 15-20 minutes at a time and was not a happy camper at all. It has been four days of this.  He still sleeps well at night- a 8 hour stretch, 45 minute feeding and then a 4-5 hour stretch. I've given him a little infant tylenol, gas drops and he already takes zantac for reflux.  Can any of you mommas give me a little insight as to what could be the problem and how to deal with it?  I'm pretty sure it is not colic.  He gets himself so worked up and it is breaking my heart as well as my husbands.  I am going to call the doctor tomorrow as well but just wanted to see what you all thought. ",6
"So my daughter has pretty much stopped eating the last few days. She'll usually eat her breakfast, which is peanut butter toast normally, but even that has started to dwindle. Things we could count on her eating, like chicken strips, cheese and raspberries and such, she will no longer eat. She'll nibble once or twice and then just play around until we take it away. Our tricks have stopped working too, like pretending to be lions or Daddy's gonna eat it, and even bribing with dessert. I'm not sure what to do, I don't want her to starve herself. She drinks water throughout the day, and today and yesterday she's been really into milk as well. I always figured I'd be Tough Mom and if she refuses to eat then so be it, she'll get hungry eventually, but in reality I can't seem to do it. We just had a baby, so I don't know if she's just acting out or something, she's been really good with the baby and she hasn't seemed jealous or anything. Any tips or advice? If I need to turn into Tough Mom I'll try, I just don't want her wasting away or something.†",1
"So my daughter is 7 months old and she hates baby food. She will eat maybe one (4oz) jar a day over the span of twelve hours, but I really have to fight her. Also, she hates pretty much everything green. What am I doing wrong?!",2
"So my family was supposed to move into a new place tomorrow. We have our whole life packed up in a uhaul right now. 
The new landlord called saying there was a mattress and a little bit of garbage left there, he'd tale $50 off the rent if we just took that stuff outside and he'd pick it up this week. We though no biggie, just taking some stuff outside saves us fifty bucks. 
When we looked at this place people were still living there and it was kinda messy but the landlord assured us that the house would be cleaned, carpets washed, walls repainted, and repairs done. We really needed a place with that much space so we signed a lease with him, trusting that it would look much better cleaned up. 
He told us the house was open tonight and we could start moving stuff in. We still decided that we wouldn't move anything until tomorrow but we wanted to show SO's mom and sister the new place so we went by. 
We pull into the driveway and there is garbage piled up against the house past the first floor windows. We go in and the house reaks of feces, urine, and mold! There is rotting food in the sink, garbage, dirt, and random items all over the floor. The stove was pulled away from the wall and the floor underneath was full of grease, dirt, and small toys(previous tenants had a child). They left tooth brushes, pill bottles, and cigarette butts all over the bathroom. The tub was full of mold, the toilet was backed up. 
Only the living and dining room were repainted, horribly, paint all over the trim and drips on the hard wood floors. The carpeting was sticky and stained. Also what we were told was wall to wall carpet was just rough cut sections of carpeting thrown over rotting hardwood. When we viewed the place all edges were covered by furniture. The bedroom walls were scratched up, with huge areas of paint missing looking like it bubbled and chipped off. The floors were once again disgusting carpet covering linoleum that was pulling up off of rotting wood. All of the closet doors were broken or missing. And less than half of the lighting fixtures worked(we checked the bulbs and they were fine), all rooms had ceiling fans that were broken. 
So I called the landlord saying it was unacceptable. He just said he could take another 50 off of the rent for us having to clean, paint, and fix everything ourselves. His logic was that $100 would cover the only 10 hours it should take to do everything!! 
Then my SO opened the basement door and a cat ran out! The landlord claimed that non of his previous tenants had animals when we signed the lease because I asked because our daughter has very bad pet dander allergies. While on the phone with him tonight he claimed that his son ran the cat out of the house because it was left behind(great guys). The cat would coming running if we went anywhere near the kitchen cupboards, obviously used to being fed and it was hungry. 
After the landlord trying to reason with us that it's not that bad, after taking pictures of everything unsafe for anyone living there, and finding that poor cat, he finally told us that we can come pick up our security deposit and be done with it. I have never been so disappointed and heartbroken. We feel like we have let our daughter down because of this but there is no way we(or anyone else) could live there! We're staying at SO's mom's house for now but everything is packed away. 
I'm sorry about the length of this but I just had to get it out of my head and off my chest. I don't know how to feel yet.
Sorry about any typos as well, I'm on my phone.",6
"So my husband and I found out we are pregnant. We told daughter (2.5 yrs), she seems pretty stoked. However, lately, she has been so clingy to me. Here are some examples: --She starts crying if daddy offers to put her to bed --she wants to sit on my lap a lot, during meal time, tv time, etc --'I want my mama' is a regular saying These are new things, have only started happening in the past two weeks. She is going through potty training, we did recently take away her pacifiers (she seems to be adjusting well to both changes). I'm wondering if this is related to the pregnancy or if it is normal for someone her age to go through attachment issues. Who else has experience with this? How long did it last? Any tips to reassure her that everything is fine? Is that even a thing to do?",6
"So my husband is usually pretty good. Honestly he isn't the best at anticipating needs. Mine or LO's. I pretty much have to tell him everything. Like she's hungry or she needs a nap. Or I'm exhausted I need a nap (14 months and we are still BF) or to sleep in once in a while. I make dinner almost every night of the week and I work 35 hours a week. My boss pays me $5 per person per day for each lunch I make, including mine. So it's an extra $100 for us each week. I also make enough for his lunch and our sitter two days out of the week. After making dinner for lunches I really work 40/42 hours a week. After dinner I usually clean up LO, jammers, breastfeed, brush teeth, keeses, and night night. So here's my issue. Durning the after dinner part he washes dishes, sometimes. Usually a good 3-4 times a week. Some times if I am not juggling the baby while cooking (because he's late or she's having a day) I'll empty the dishwasher and load up as much as possible. He still gives me soon much grief about doing the dishes. Most of the time I've already done half if them. Then he doesn't put up the dishes that were clean. He will put up 85-90% of it but not all. If I say anything, he gets pissy. He complains he's tired from work (but I work too so jeez get over it) and that he just wants to rest. Now mind you again while I'm cooking dinner he's kind of playing with the baby. Unless he starts watching TV or on his damn phone. Then she wanders over to me and starts getting upset that I haven't picked her up or play with her. I'm just tired of the asking. How do I get him to understand I'm his equal. I'm tired too, I'm equally exhausted. Plus I'm doing everything I can to help out our family. I just want to be appreciated. How do I tell him to take his pissy attitude and shove it, while still saying hey I love you and need your help. Anyway, guess it's more of a vent then a question. I don't know.",6
"So my little guy (and I do mean little) is not quite 15 months. He's around 30 and weights 20lbs on a good day. He's never had an enormous appetite. He seems to like to exercise his curiosity about food and taste new things  soy milk  goat's milk  sweetened milk  unsweetened mil) from a cup. It's like he can sense calories and knows to flee! He seems to have plenty of energy  he poops between 1 and 3 times a day  and he sleeps fairly well  but damned if I know what he's subsisting on. I just get so frustrated trying to feed him. Logically I know he'll grow past this  illogically I think I'm just looking for reassurance. Thanks for listening. """,2
"So my little guy as recently become the pickiest eater, when before he ate almost anything that was put in front of him. Lately, he refuses to feed himself, unless it's dry snack foods like crunches or Cheerios. It's almost as if he doesn't want to get his hands dirty. At the same time he also doesn't love being spoon fed either. He will, however devour things like grits, baby cereal and bananas (me feeding him). Everything else is a negotiation to just get him to take a bite. I get the worst anxiety that he's not getting enough to eat and I lose my patience sometimes. He's not teething right now and he drinks plenty of fluids and milk, by the way. Any suggestions would be hugely appreciated. Thank you!",2
"So my nephew comes over ever so often, and when he does the neighbourhood kids join in. Sometimes the kids just come around anyway on their bikes and scooters and whatnot. But that isnt the issue. 
These kids somehow are magnetically drawn to my car that sits in the driveway. They fly into to driveway with their bikes and scooters barely breezing the car as they do. I have told them several times to not use their stuff in the driveway, and to use the road. (its not really a road, we live on a cul de sac, so only local traffic uses it and the view is very very clear so you can see cars coming in from way down the street.
Anyway i have told them at least 5 times today, and when i came out the little asshats are leaning up on my car bumper with their feet on my garage door. (these are my nephews friends, my nephew was on the road with another friend). it took all my bearings not to scream at them. They just do not listen to me or my partner. My car has been dinged several times on the side they drive in on. I cant prove they did it but i am so sure it is them. The many scratches are right at handle bar level. 
So what can i do about other kids not listening to me? the thing is the parents dont give a shit, they are never out watching their kids and ive had to feed them more that a dozen times because they were locked out at noon hour or at dinner and the parents are gone. 
Im completely at a loss and so close to flipping out. I want to tell the parents but as i said they pretty much have zero holds on their kids.",6
"So my sister, about a decade older than me and has two kids of her own informed me today that I was wrong to give my 3 year old who is in the middle of a crazy growth spurt more mac and cheese. Because apparently its important to vary food groups. Well no duh. My wonderful daughter loves her fruits and vegetables and its pretty much all she will eat 9 times out of 10. Tonight at dinner with all of my siblings she was being a good girl and ate her chicken and asked nicely for a little more mac and cheese and my sister in front of my child and immediately after i said okay gives me this rude passive aggressive lecture on nutrition. Seriously, my daughter eats healthier than both of her kids, but I would NEVER judge her or tell her how to feed them. Grr it made me so mad. I was proud of myself and I just said you know I agree its important to vary but right now she is hungry and I think its more important that she eats than make a big fuss"" I still got more snark but at least I was the bigger person. Seriously People as a mother if you would be pissed if someone said something to you DO NOT say it to another mother Daycare and bringing own food This question is mostly for the parents that bring their own food when they bring their kids to daycare. 
28147,We have a 10.5 month old and she has always had real whole foods since 6 months. We tried the BLW but it was too nerve-wracking initially.
28148,She goes to daycare only twice a week and when I pack her food, I try to pack things that are easy for her to eat on her own so they don't have to be feeding her. 
28149,I always pack two peeled clementines, since she loves them and a cheese stick. From there I will add either blueberries, cherries, watermelon....whatever is on hand. 
28150,Then I give one or two of the pouch foods (sprouts brand or the happy ones) in a variety of flavors everyday.
28151,This morning when I dropped her off - the mgr there (who is always passive aggressive with what she says) tells me that I should think about giving her the food that they give since Inga looks at the other kids food a lot. I said that we would prefer real whole foods and she said well Gerber makes some. I was trying to be nice and said I would check them out. She then says to me Yeah I just thought I would say something since she might be getting sick of eating the same thing""........excuse me what? My daughter is with my mom most of the week and she eats everything under the sun o that just annoys me. There is probably back story that could be told to emphasize why that annoys me so much but I won't bother. Do you guys have any suggestions of what you bring for food for your child to daycare when they aren't quite eating whole pieces of food easily but they don't want to live on purees? Thanks!""",3
"So my son is 1 month old as of this past Monday, and it's been the greatest time of my life, and my wife and I have been do so far really well with meeting his needs. But last night I feel like I failed as a father at that time...basically he hit a growth spurt over the weekend and has been so much more hungrier than normal, feeding a lot and my wife exclusively breastfeeds, and because of this he has became a lot more fussier as well.  Last night around 1 in the morning, he started crying( he just finished feeding about 10 minutes ago, and I was trying to let the wife sleep/recover) and I started to hold him close(skin to skin contact), and trying to soothe and comfort him while rocking as well, but nothing was working and as I was looking at him, seeing that precious, sad, face of his crying his heart out...it broke my heart and in this family I'm the strength and foundation(I'm the only one working) of this family, and so I just didn't want my wife to see my cry, but it was so hard...Finally my wife wanted to feed him because that was the only thing that soothes him at the time. Well once she took him, I had to go to bed because I had to get up in a few hours to sleep, needless to say, I did the manliest/unmanliest thing and just silently cried myself to sleep because at that moment I felt weak and helpless that I couldn't comfort my son.
Sorry for the long rant, but just wanted to get it out there.",6
"So my son is 8 months old. Has been on solids since 6 months and has always dropped somethings which is fine fruit is slippy ect.

"So my son is almost 17 weeks old (four months one week), and he was sleeping through the night in his pack and play perfectly fine since he was about two months old. Within the last few days he's stopped sleeping through the night. He wakes up several times to eat and when he falls asleep and we try to put him back in his bed, he wakes up and cries, so I put him back on my other boob and just let him stay there the rest of the night. It's really uncomfortable for me to be sleeping on my side the entire night, but it's the only way that all three of us can fit on our bed. I read in some baby book that around four months babies will wake up in the night to practice rolling over and stuff, but when he wakes up, there isn't any practicing to be had, he just cries until I feed him. He is teething, but he's been teething for a while now and it hasn't had any effect on his sleep until this last week. I'm wondering if anyone has had this happen to them as well, and how to remedy it? Should I just go with the flow? My MIL said to give him baby rice or something, but I don't want to start any kind of solids without my pediatrician's approval.",6
"So my son just turned 10 months old a few days ago. He is formula fed and usually has four or five bottles a day that are six oz each. We also offer him 3 meals a day and a snack with a sippy cup of water and recently almond milk. 
My issue is..he doesn't eat much. He eats all table food and some times squeeze pouches. He will eat like five or six bites then get bored and play with the rest or throw it on the floor. If water is in his sippy he will drink a few swigs but if its almond milk he will drink 4-5 oz. 
I offer him eggs, toast, all kinds of fresh fruit, steamed or baked veggies, chicken, cheese... And he will try everything but only eat a few bites. We did baby led weaning so he is accustomed to eating solid food. 
I'm nervous because when he is a year old he is supposed to go off formula and on to whole milk. I don't know how to do it! He still drinks so much out of his bottle for his main source of nutrition. How do I get him to realize food can fill him up too? And how do I get him off the bottle and on to a sippy cup full time? (He does really well with his regular and straw sippy already but still prefers his bottle.)  
Am I being ridiculous for worrying about this? I feel like he should be down to maybe 2 bottles a day by now..",2
"So my two kiddos have been sick since Thursday. It stared with the 3 1/2 year old puking, and went from there. I called their doctor, and they said the usual stuff. Drink lots of stuff, stay away from dairy and not-bland food. Everything seemed to be manageable and we got on with life. They seemed like they were both doing fine by Saturday, a bit of diarrhea but no more vomiting. Then I started letting them eat more than crackers and watered down juice. They would be fine for more than 12 hours, then they would throw up one time.
I know this last time, it was close to 24 hours between when they threw up, and it was just one time each. The only thing I can link between these times is giving them some milk, but even then, I gave them milk at other times during the day and they were okay, but not over night.
I'm just looking for some thoughts from those who have been there. Is it likely just I'm giving milk too soon? Is it just an odd symptom of the bug? If it is just the milk, any thoughts on what else I can give my 2 year old? I have been giving them watered down juice, but that tends to make his diarrhea quite a bit worse. Would love some thoughts from more experienced moms.",6
"So next week my boss's boss will be here from the UK. Apparently he wants to have a department dinner on Wednesday. I can seriously only think of a few things I'd rather NOT do. I can count on one hand the number of times my husband has successfully put our 6 month old to sleep, so I'm kind of panicking. I cosleep with the Little without husband (he's a crappy sleeper), and nurse to sleep. He's been having some serious sleep regressions for the last week, and been up at least once an hour between his bedtime (6:30) and mine (9-10pm) where he has to be nursed back to sleep. It's been putting a real damper on my evenings when I hardly get the time to shower and eat dinner before he needs me. Anyway, this work dinner is right at Little's bedtime and I'm really trying to not stress about it, but that's just not possible. I can't go all day without seeing his drooly little face, but I also don't want my boss's boss to think I'm a slacker if I either miss the dinner, or take off work early to see my son before the 6pm dinner.

What foods did you start feeding your babies after their first birthday?
Another question,  did you consult your pediatrician before beginning to switch to whole milk? I am almost halfway through a can of formula and it would be great to not have to buy anymore.

So our 10 month old daughter just had a dirty diaper and part of it was white. Anyone else experience this? Should we be concerned? Trying to figure out if we should just watch it or if she needs to be seen. Thanks guys. Update: she had another BM last night with mucus in it and then a bm this morning with undigested food in it. I took her to the pediatrician who said the mucus was concerning but the undigested food wasn't a big deal by itself. Didn't really say much about the white poop. Doc said to keep an eye on it and he weighed her and from her April appointment to now she has lost an ounce. Said he doesn't like that but not concerned yet because she had a stomach bug last week and she tends to spike up quick and then plateau. So...kinda just a waiting game now I guess.. thank you all very much for your experiences and advice I really appreciate it.,6
"So our 3 year old daughter has been potty trained during day since she was about 17 months old. She picked up daytime training very quickly, just one weekend, and naps came soon after without much work. 
I didn't push for bedtime because I had read enough that it's just a physical milestone and it'll happen when it does. We never let her drink fluids after dinner (5:30-6:30) and have her use the bathroom right before bedtime (in bed by 8, start routine around 7:30). She wakes at 7am and it seems like more often than not she has a full pull-up. I've caught her a few times on the toilet very early in the morning, though. 
The only other thing I've read is to wake her before my husband and I go to bed to use the toilet. I really do not want to do this and disrupt her sleep. I'd almost rather have her continue to use pull-ups. Has anyone else done this? How long did you have to continue to wake them before their bodies adjusted?
Any tips anyone might have would be great! I'm not too worried about it, but she's been potty trained for so long I thought this would have happened by now. ",6
"So over the past two years my son has gotten increasingly fatter.  I try to encourage good eating habits- I cook dinner 6nights a week, make him eat fruits and/or veggies with every meal and snack.  I have him in soccer and swimming.  Part of this started when we moved about an hr away from his father and he started staying with his dad for longer periods of time (before he would see his dad for a few hrs here and there throughout the week).  His dad is overweight and thinks it's funny to feed him 6tacos from Taco Bell in one sitting.  My son now thinks he needs to eat that much and complains that he's hungry almost constantly.   I don't know what else to do to get him back to a healthy weight. ",3
"So she's seven months old and she won't eat and hardly takes a bottle. I'm talking four ounces at most, and she absolutely positively will not eat food. There is not one kind of pur√©e that she'll even merely tolerate. If I try all day (I'm talking once every couple of hours) I can get her to eat maybe half a container.
Help",2
"So stretch marks, lots of people have them, right?  [I have them,](http://i.imgur.com/COzKkgj.jpg) I am 27 and the mother of a 6 month old bundle of joy.  I have stretch marks.  I have them, they got me. Now, I have always had some stretch marks.  A few on my hips and bust from puberty, but after gaining 70 pounds with my pregnancy... I know, I know you'll say ewww, thats unhealthy, gross, the recommended weight gain is 30 lbs. The truth is not all of us can be so lucky, I had so much water weight on me it was insane, plus I went from an active job to a desk job well equipped with free donuts. I don't even really like donuts but try telling that to my previously pregnant body.
I now have the whole stretch mark package: boobs, thighs, and a web of them that go from pelvis to well above my belly button. They have been fading gradually to the point where, you wont believe this but, I actually don't mind them so much. In fact, if I were about 15 lbs trimmer I think I would feel pretty comfortable in a bikini. I was contemplating wearing one to the pool today.
Now, if I can muster up the courage to flaunt my mommy stripes, why is it that other more public figures (ie A-list celebrities) haven't flaunted them (with the purpose of flaunting them) for the rest of us as a celebration of motherhood. Its one thing to admit to having stretch marks, but quite another to show them off.
There are a few websites with this flaunt your stretch marks"" train of thought  and feel bad about yourself for having them. Lets paint these mommy stripes a new image. Face reality  don't deface it  don't hide it. Flaunt it and feel good about it. There is too much depressing shit out there telling us we need to paint ourselves beautiful. Nature is beauty. Stretch marks included.""",6
"So summer is here, and coupled with a tendency of PPD I would prefer to go over most days without eating anything at all. Of course, the kids (3.5, 2, the 4mo doesn't really count yet) need to be fed nonetheless. Often I cop out by making a picnic outside - that's basically a big tasty loaf of bread and several things to just take and eat, but obviously I can't do that every day. I want to fill my freezer with things that I just have to throw into the pan or oven and have a sort-of-acceptable meal some time later. For instance, our local Lidl had some awesome rice-veggies-sticks that you only have to fry up, but they're a seasonal offer :( also, since we're European, our frozen pizzas are not *quite* as crappy as it might sound, but I would still feel guilty relying on them too much. Pasta, with bought sauce/pesto, is about as far as I'd like the preperatons to go on such days. Thanks :3",4
"So the wife and I wanted to do a minor domestic vacation. The two big things we were looking for were swimming and a place to walk around with stuff to see. We looked at several beach locations but that would mean driving 10+ hours in order to stay in the budget we wanted.
Then my wife got the idea for Vegas. We can fly there and stay 4 nights for the cost of just the hotel in other locations. We found a non-smoking non-gaming hotel a block off the strip. We can swim in the pool, walk through the town, and eat better food that you can find in beach front towns.
My daughter is young enough that big cool flashing lights will be about as entertaining as anything. Plus and trips in the next 10-12 years will likely involve very kid heavy cartoon-mouse filled types of experiences. Is this crazy?",6
"So there is another lady asking what to do with her one year old, and I thought I'd turn to you ladies for some tips.
22545,
22546,My daughter is 7months old and I just don't know what to do with her! She's really happy just chilling by herself but I feel like I should be more actively interacting with her. I try reading with her and she just wants to eat the books.. She sits and plays with her blocks while I'm there going 'yes that's the green block, it's a square- oh look this ones pink and it's a circle..' Yawn she's not interested. She does tummy time in front of a mirror. We go for walks with the dog and do errands, but I feel like most of the time I'm just doing my own thing while she's just nearby chilling out..
22547,She's not crawling or rolling (she's done it a couple of times but not regularly) but 'stands' really well so maybe some activities to encourage these things??
22548,
22549,So tell me fellow mommit-ers what do you do with your 6-9month olds?",6
"So these may be painfully obvious, I'm not sure. But after two kids I've developed a few little mommy tricks that help me circumvent those annoying parenting moments. These seem to work for my kids. I'd like to share them in case they help anyone out there. - Keep a captivating toy by a change table to keep your whirling dervish still during a diaper change. Sometimes I keep it in my mouth so he focuses on trying to get it from me instead of spinning around on the change table. That way my hands are free to get that diaper on. - I hate trying to get a cranky baby (who has decided to make his legs go stiff as a board) into his high chair. Usually the food is enough to make him sit, but when I'm still not done preparing I put something really attractive to him on the tray (like my iPhone he's always trying to get). Presto! He bends those legs and I strap his ass down! †- My baby hates his cereal. I pretend to feed him a piece of fruit and sneak a spoonful when his mouth is open, and then give him the fruit. Seems sneaky but at least he gets his iron rich cereal and I don't have to worry about anemia! - When my baby learned to roll over and stand in the crib I started gently holding him down after I laid him in the crib. Stopping him from rolling over meant he would drift off to sleep instead of holding on to the bars screaming at me. -Always keep an arsenal of favorite toys/ books in the car. I keep them in the front seat and when baby or toddler is getting cranky I pass a new toy back to them. When I don't want my baby to fall asleep in his car seat (when we are on the go and it's getting close to nap time), I give him an empty water bottle. He loves to squeeze and click it. This keeps him awake for the car ride and then he has a proper nap at home. (We haven't had a successful transfer yet) Do you have any slight of hand tricks that make your life less painful?†",1
"So this happened today, and is fairly common when dining out...  My wife, two kids (4 and 1) and I were quietly enjoying a healthy meal when the restaurant owner came by our table with some candy in colorful wrappers, placed them in front of the children and then asked, Is it okay for the kids to have these?""  ",6
So this is my first baby she's a girl and I'm 32 weeks along. She likes carrots and fruit but is it bad that I don't feel that motherly love yet? I feel little kicks and little punches but that's it. I love baby clothes and I can't wait to dress her in cute little clothes. And I love the way they laugh when they think something is funny. But has anyone eles felt like this? Where you didn't love the baby until he/she was born? I'm scared about labor the whole situation but I would feel better knowing other mama's have gone through this feeling,6
"So this may seem gross, but desperate times call for desperate measures. We've been out of power due to the blizzard for about a week now. Hubby's at work with the car, and my homemade baby food has all gone bad. Baby girl is hungry, and I'm running out of options. I've tried chopping, squashing, pressing, and even punching the food. Baby is growing hungrier. Nothing is thin enough for her two tiny little teeth. Then-**bam!** it hits me. I run to the bathroom, brush my teeth with bottled water, rinse a few extra times, and grab a banana. Chew, chew, chew, and I bring my mouth to hers. Like a newborn baby bird, she opens her mouth and accepts the food. With a satisfied smile, she looks up and lets out a, mmmm"". It was so bonding",2
"So today we spent all day long running from MIL to meet my mom. My MIL wanted my absolute least favorite meal for lunch, and the dinner with my mom turned into pizza (1. Hate pizza, 2. On major diet) because the wait was too long at the restaurant she wanted. So we decided next year, my mother's day will be on Saturday where I can relax and get a meal I like, and enjoy my kids in a peaceful environment, then retreat to a quiet bath whenever I want. I would've had a better day but somehow I though I'd get that nice time in between running between my husband and my mom's. My husband and daughter did a great job at trying to salvage the day, but I just want my hot bath and peace and quiet now!",6
"So we have a happy, silly, and adventurous 13 month old.  And while we have baby proved much of the house our dogs food bowl tends to be of great interest to out LO.  Every time she goes for it we correct her and call to her as she attempts to get to it, but usually this makes her run faster.  Any advice on how to teach her that the dogs food is off limits?",6
"So we just took a road trip from FL to NY and got back Sunday night. Since coming home my son will not let me out of his sight, seriously not even to pee. He fell asleep in his crib today and I went down stairs to eat my husband ran into his room because he let out a shriek that sounded like someone had stepped on him. The only thing that calms him is to nurse him. I am really not a fan of the CIO method but I am willing to try anything to make him move past this faze. I tried talking to him from other rooms but it just makes him scream louder.†",6
"So we just went for a check-up with the pediatrician yesterday and he says my four-month-old has doubled in weight in the last two months. He was in the 25th percentile for weight and now he's in the 97th, and he's the size of an average 8- or 9-month-old. (!?) So the pediatrician wants me to consider introducing solids now. I know very little about babies and I'm not very domestic; I don't know where to start. Can anyone give me some advice/tips or recommend a great book or web site? EDIT: Gosh, people take this pretty seriously. Thanks for the advice, everyone! I'll try not to kill him with rice cereal. ;)",2
"So we went in for the 18 month checkup, and everything is fine and dandy. (Except obviously what this post is about)

My pediatrician asked if we were still feeding milk in bottles. I answered in a the affirmative, only before naps and nighttime, and mayyyybeeee if she wakes up in the middle of the night.
Pediatrician says now is the time to start weaning away from that because it's not good for her teeth to have that in the mouth before bed. It honestly was something I'd never thought about before. Baby is pretty easygoing, so we switched to warm water in the bottle, and she seemed to be ok with that change to the night routine. 
BUT (You knew it was coming)
She wakes up in the middle of the night now. Screaming. until we feed her. and then she's awake so we might as well play for a little while, right, mom?
UGH.
So I went back to milk because **I** clearly was not ready for the transition.
over the weekend we basically tried to pack her full of protein food right before bedtime, and then do water bottles again. Same issue. Waking up and the only thing that will make her happy is food.
I don't want her eating in her bedroom or her crib. If I take her out of there to feed her, it's party time, not nap time.
Please tell me someone has some advice about this transition away from night milk bottles? Help? PLEASE!",6
"So Wednesday nights my husband plays softball so it's usually a girl night with me and my 9 year old. We usually go to the library, come home and make dinner together, put the baby down to sleep then snuggle up on the couch and watch Netflix. We just finished Gilmore girls, seeing Rory grow up and set an example for her was awesome. We're currently rewatching our favorite episodes now... but I was wondering if anyone has similar movies or series we can watch that would set a similar example or is equally as entertaining? Thanks!",6
"So when I got pregnant with my now-two year old, I was (and still am) overweight. Not grossly obese or anything but about 30 lbs heavier than I'd like to be. I was back down to my pre-baby weight within a few weeks of birth and I've lost a few more lbs since then. I'm getting serious with my diet, yoga and strength training lately and I plan on losing at least 20 lbs before I try for another baby. I had slightly high blood pressure at the end of my first pregnancy and of course the usual fatigue and discomfort. I assume losing weight will help avoid those things? Has anyone had an overweight pregnancy and a fit one? What were the differences?",6
"So WTF we were shopping at a Target in College Point NY and my wife was breastfeeding.  Then an associate approached us and asked her to cover up because she might offend one of the other guests, particularly mentioning muslims (she was an older cotton haired caucasion woman).  It was really out of the blue, embarrassed my wife and just got me so angry.  In NYS a woman's right to breastfeed is protected by NYS Civil Law (http://www.capitaldistrictfun.com/category/feminism/breastfeeding/) so I pushed the issue.  My wife wasn't breaking any laws, in fact she was protected by the law.  Women in our state are even allowed to go completely topless if they wanted to.  She was a bit dumbfounded and could only respond with people from other cultures may get offended"" I told her they didn't have to look The only the associate could say was she's welcome to breast feed as long as she covers up and walked away.  I wish I remembered to get her name but I was pretty livid and we just left our cart and the store.  Tomorrow I'm going to help my wife write them an e-mail tho I can't find that particular store's email address  but I will CC the CEO of Target.  Anyway I don't think I've ever defended anyone as rabidly as I did and I just needed to vent.  Thanks reddit.   """,6
"So yesterday my son turned 6 months! We were out to breakfast, and I let him gnaw on some strawberries in celebration, he loved it! didn't eat very much but enjoyed the process (I think!)For dinner we made sweet potato baked ""fries"" (since he's had pureed already) and gave him some. He loved chewing on it, but he got a rather large piece off and it was more fibrous than we expected (meaning not all mushy) and he gagged. I ended up helping sweep the big piece out of his mouth and it was pretty large, I'm a little nervous (and I think my husband is too) now... Especially since choking is why our pediatrician (at least one in the practice, seeing another this afternoon for his regular checkup) is against BLW... He didn't seem to want any more of it after this happened. I offered some water in a bottle to help wash any food down, and then breast milk after.And I see conflicting advice as to offering small pieces or a large piece that he can chew on and which is better to prevent choking. :/Any thoughts? Thanks! ",2
"So, a little background. My daughter was born at 37 weeks weighing in at a little under 5 pounds. She was perfectly healthy, but TINY. I breastfed exclusively 'til she was about 5.5 months, and she gained weight perfectly. Then, we started solids, and everything went downhill. 
She is SUPER picky and mealtimes have always been a chore. Right now, the only thing I know she'll eat FOR SURE is Ramen noodles, and that normally ends up being a replacement for whatever I've cooked, since she won't eat our regular lunch/dinner 99% of the time. I know I've spoiled her in that respect (giving her things I know she likes if she won't eat what's prepared), but she is so skinny (not even on the weight chart for her age anymore) and I just can't let her go hungry. From what her caregivers tell me, she eats fine at daycare when she sees other kids eat. I've come in and seen her eat things she won't even TRY when we're at home. 
This has become extremely frustrating for me, and I'm seriously starting to dread mealtimes. I'm a single mom, so the responsibility is on me, and I feel awful when I see how little she's eaten. This is an ongoing thing and a battle every single day, and I just don't know how to handle it anymore. I've tried just not letting her leave the table until she at least TRIES what is on her plate, but that just results in epic tantrums and food on the floor. 
Eh, I've made this long enough. Parents with non-eaters, how did you deal with it and, more importantly, how did you get your kids to eat?
**Edit**: Didn't mention how old she is, hah. Turned 2 in July.",2
"So, forgive me my ignorance, but my daughter is 9 months old and I'm really not sure what her meals should look like. Our ped won't give us any solid information(he's the best one in town, we can't switch unless we want to drive an hour away for a 20-minute visit and vaccinations, and on everything else he's amazing) because he doesn't want to contradict the endocrinologists, who specialize in children's endocrinology but are not pediatricians.
My daughter has type 2 diabetes, but she can eat what a non-diabetic child eats, according to the endos. She is not allergic to anything as of yet. What do I feed this poor child??",2
"So, I have a 12-year-old son and two younger step-daughters. I have struggled with my weight my entire life. It's a family thing, so have my mother and grandmother. I'm 5'9 My mother is OBSESSED with my weight. To the point where it became a real hindrance on our adult relationship. She started me dieting at age 8. And it's been a long and storied history of ridiculous ups and downs with both our weight. She has terrible eating habits which she passed on to me. Which I am apparently passing on to my son. He's 12  and is just now starting to put on weight  at the same time I don't want him to have the same complex I did about food and weight and I sure as hell don't want him to feel bad about his body like my mother made me feel.  He and his step-sisters have VERY different metabolisms. They (and their fathers) have the whole ""I can eat literally anything I want and never put on any weight metabolism. My son and I have the, Look at a box of cookies and put on 10 lbs."" kind. They are both thin as rails and has fluctuated with weight a lot too.  So my question is: Is there a good way to tackle getting slimmer/eating healthier/getting more exercise together as a family  but *I* don't love my body and still feel shame about being so out of shape and fat. I don't want to give any of them a complex about food or make them feel guilty for eating when they're hungry",6
"So, I was getting ready to feed and put my 2 month old down for the night. He was already mad but I had to change him and put him in his pajamas before I could feed him since he usually falls asleep while/immediately after eating. Anyway, he was screaming and crying as I was changing his diaper, when suddenly he stops, his arms and legs sort of flail out and he has this scared/pained look on his face for a second, then he screams even louder/more intensely. It scared me and I picked him up as soon as I finished putting on his diaper and he almost immediately stopped crying and seemed fine as soon as I was holding him. I was so freaked out I was crying haha. After cuddling and feeding I put him down and now he's asleep, but does anyone know what could have happened? I had never seen this before today, but earlier this afternoon he did it while we were playing on the floor. At that time he was happy and then did the freak out thing and started crying, but I had thought it was because the dog licked his toes right at that moment and maybe it startled him. This time though he was up on the changing table and mid-diaper change, nothing strange touching him, nothing unusual going on (besides him being pissed that there wasn't a boob in his mouth). I seriously panicked, the look on his face was hard to describe, almost like when you blow in a baby's face and they catch their breath, except more terrified looking. I'll probably take him to the doctor next week just for my own peace of mind, but I thought I'd ask if anyone else has experienced this?",6
"So, I've enjoyed a happy, healthy breast feeding relationship with my son for the past 12 months. He took to it like a champ and nothing satisfies him like the boob. He does eat solids, but will stop while he's still a bit hungry just to make sure there's enough room for milk. All in all, I'd say it's his favorite thing... 
Lately, however, it's been bittersweet for me. He seems to want to nurse all. the. time. I'm getting the idea that, even though he's growing properly with our current set up, my milk isn't meeting his needs quite as much. Since he is only willing to eat so much solid food, however, he's really struggling to get enough calories throughout the day. 
In and of itself, that's worrisome and leads me to want to find an alternative. The other part to all of this (and what makes me sad) is that I feel like I'm just a big walking boob to him. He loves to play and act goofy with everyone else, but me? As soon as he sees me, his eyes go from my face to my breasts and he starts clawing at my clothes. It's like he can't imagine me being good for anything else.
Other pertinent details: he won't (and has never wanted to) drink any other milk from any other source (cup, bottle, sippy cup...). I recently night weaned him (in the last week or so) but this behavior started well before this.
Is it time to day wean? And if so, how do I start?",6
"So, Lily is 13 months old now... and I've been wondering. She really likes raisins. Is it bad to give her a lot? Not like, tons, but she really likes them. I almost feel like they're junk! I try to make sure she has at least a fruit and a veg at every meal besides raisins, too. But man she likes her raisins!",1
"So, me and my wife have a 3 year old who is a handful. He is a very active toddler and we are having issues with his sleeping and eating. This is our first child, so maybe this stuff is normal, but I figured I'd post this and see if anyone had any advice.
At about 1 year, we got him a big boy bed. To get him used to not being rocked to sleep before going into his crib, we made the mistake of one of us laying with him until he fell asleep. Now, he will not go to sleep on his own. Even worse, if he wakes up in the middle of the night and finds that we aren't there anymore, he gets up and will not go back to sleep without one of us. 
We have tried everything. Cry it out (he will cry until he is red in the face, almost making himself sick). A night light. Music. The big boy talk. Stuffed animals. Nothing has worked. Also, if mommy is the one to put him to bed, he throws a fit, but eventually gets over it. He naps once a day, and if he misses his nap, he gets overtired and is even worse at night. On top of all that, it usually takes him upwards of 2 hours to fall asleep, even when someone is in there with him.
Eating is just as bad. He usually takes over an hour to eat every meal. Normal behavior is him playing with his silverware, singing/making noises, getting out of/squirming in his chair, etc. We have also tried everything from yelling, light spankings, explaining to him why it's bad behavior, timeouts. Nothing works.
He is a very smart and polite 3 year old. No attitude really. When we tell him he isn't behaving he says he's sorry, but 30 seconds later, he's doing it again.
Sorry for the lengthy post, just a chance to vent I guess. Any suggestions would be great. ",1
"So, my 4 month old son has been having blood in his stool on and off for a while now, GI specialist ordered testing that came back positive for an allergic response to something in my diet (EBF). I've cut out dairy and soy from my diet per her orders, and so far no more bleeding. If the bleeding comes back he has to be switched to special formula like neocate. 
I was wondering if this is a temporary allergy and he will grow out of it or a permanent one. Anyone who has had to deal with this, I'd like to hear your opinion! Any sneaky sources of the forbidden food I should watch out for? ",6
"So, my day care sent home a readymade bottle for my 5mo old (They were about to feed him, but it was the end of the day, so i just took it with me). We usually give him 6oz in a bottle, and this bottle was full almost to the brim. This is a [Playtex DropIn](http://playtexbaby.com/Bottles/Dropins/Premium-Nurser) bottle, FYI. 
So I call up the day care and ask them what the deal is, this is much more than 6oz of formula. They tell me that they premix the formula, measure it in a separate measuring cup, and then pour 6oz of formula solution in the bottle. This confounds me, so I do a little experiment of my own. I grab my own measuring cup, fill it with 6oz of water, and pour it into the bottle. Lo and behold, it fills to something like 7.5 oz according to the markings on the side of the bottle. 
Am I completely missing something here, or is Playtex being very irresponsible about their dropin measurements? Has anyone run into this before? I know an +/- an oz or two isn't really detrimental to my kid as long as he's happy and pooping normally, but I still find this very bizarre.
**Update: I got some Playtex liners, and lo and behold, 6oz of water is now an accurate measurement both in a measuring cup and in a liner. That's kinda irresponsible on the off-brand liners' part.**",6
"So, my son will be 3 years old in October. I have been through hell and back trying to get him to eat real food"" ever since trying to introduce him to anything and everything he'd be able to handle starting at around 7 months old. Everyone always said ""he'll eat when he's older At his 2-year wellness checkup I discussed with his pediatrician that he really only eats oatmeal  fruit and french toast or pancakes. She *finally* found it odd and suggested I take him to a nutritionist. We went there and she thought it may just be a textural issue but that there was nothing really she could do other than point me in a different direction: ""occupational feeding therapy."" **Feeding therapy**? That sounded absolutely ridiculous to me. I didn't want to admit there may be a problem with my son. I didn't want to be one of *those* moms that takes their kid to the doctor for every little thing that may or may not be a problem. I told her I'd consider it; and although it was somewhere in the back of my mind  I didn't really want to go through a therapy process for something I was sure would fix itself. Fast forward to 6 weeks ago - my SO scared me. He said ""what if that therapy would help? What if you aren't doing everything you could be doing to help him? What if it *could* be getting fixed but the older he gets  trick and suggestion I'd researched or been told by friends & family so what would they possibly do that I hadn't yet?

"So, my wife is down for a few weeks with morning sickness, meaning I'm in charge of childcare and food.
I don't usually get home from work until dinner-time, so I'd like to pre-make a bunch of meals for my kids (2 and 4) who are kinda picky eaters.

"So, my youngest is 7 months old. Since he was a few weeks old I noticed his pee smelled a little funny. It mostly just smelled like his poo but hey, it's breastmilk poop so really I thought it was all in the range of normal"". I really didn't think anything of it until the smell changed to bacon when he was around 6 months old (late March Yes bacon. You read that right. I hated bacon because of the smell.  I still wasn't concerned really. I googled and of course a slew of horror stories came up but also some stories of ""it's normal"" came up and I'm the skeptical type so I went with normal.  A week later he cut his first two teeth and had a raging fever of 102.7-103. My SO has a febrile seizure history and anytime my kids have fevers above 102 I start panicking because his seizures always trigger at 102 on the dot. Every bone in my body was screaming ""THIS ISN'T A TEETHING FEVER!!""  And I was right. We called our ped and she had us come in that day. It was too high for teething. I told her about the bacon smell and she did a urine test. 3 days later we get the results of a very very bad UTI. Our doctor is Hindu and the Hindu religion doesn't circumcise which is a huge plus for us since we do not circumcise our boys. We've never had that horrible fight that I've heard so much about from friends she's never tried to retract him  it's only when the foreskin becomes unadhered (not a word apparently but who cares) that you run into the UTI problem.  So since he's got his good ole foreskin and the severity of the infection she was concerned. We tried one antibiotic and went back to see if it was gone. Nope. Either it was gone and came back or didn't go away He finished his antibiotics last Thursday and we did another urine sample this Monday. We get the results Thursday. If he still has it: more antibiotics. But if it's gone here's when the real fun starts. He has to have an ultrasound to check for enlarged kidneys and a dye test to check to make sure he doesn't have reflux. Depending on those results we get several options. If he has reflux depending on the severity Surgery. That word broke me. I was holding my little man and just lost it. I know it's a big IF but still. Just the thought of it kills me. And to top it off I had a lovely nightmare about 2 weeks later that he freaking dies in surgery. I woke up screaming and crying and ran to the pack & play to get him (my SO watches TV after I go to bed so he keeps little guy in the living room with him until he is either hungry or is going to bed himself).  Thank you for reading if you didn't want to read enjoy the TLDR.  TLDR: Littlest had very bad UTI and will require tests to determine the cause and will either be on antibiotics for quite a while or will need surgery. Update: I called his Dr this morning and my favorite nurse answered and said she was just about to call the lab to see if they could fax it over early since she knows I'll keep calling until they do. I've apologized profusely for my obsessive calling but she's very understanding. I called again an hour later and they had just been faxed over but the dr hadn't looked at them yet. She told me anyway since it was good news and wanted me to stop worrying (and calling probably). From what she can tell his UTI is gone still waiting on word back from the doctor and then onto the hospital for his other tests. I ran and picked him up and snuggled his tiny face and neck. My mood is fantastic. I know we have a long road ahead of us but just this tiny bit of good news is enough for now.",6
"So, Nathan has been 'weaning' for the last 2 weeks. I say weaning, mostly 'me poking the spoon at him and him being confused as to what the hell I was doing.' Today we had the first breakthrough and he NOMMED the spoon AND the solids it contained. This was pear and baby rice. So far he's tried: * Carrot * Apple * Sweet Potato * Banana * Pear + Baby Rice Now we've had said breakthrough, I am defrosting the carrot portion for him to see if he actually eats it. I'm mainly on the lookout for fruit and veg suggestions now. My plan is to mix puraed fruit with his baby rice/porridge for breakfast and then use it for dessert and start him on veg for his 'main' meals in a few weeks. This is only because I ordered the Cow and Gate 5-Step Weaning Plan and they recommend starting the proper 'meal routine' with breakfast - but baby rice/porridge is dull as dishwater so I'm planning on making it more interesting and fun with the above plan. So any suggestions or perhaps any no-nos? I won't be trying him on meat until he's six months. I have the Phillips Avent Blender/Steamer so I can steam anything - the booklet only has a limited range of fruit and vegetables in it and timings so I need to compare them. E.g. Nectarine would be the same as Peach etc. So - throw ideas at me. Possible weird and wacky combinations also good too. [Pear & Baby Rice Face](http://i.imgur.com/KKFCD)",2
"So, P is about to be 15 months and the last few days she's been sleeping a little less, eating a bit less, but drinking a lot more. This doesn't meet up with her previous growth spurts so I was curious to see if any other mamas have gone through this and if maybe these are signs of her starting to get sick. But it also doesn't seem like she may be.

She **does**

* sleep less
 eat less
* drinks more fluids (water, milk and only one cup of juice a day if that)

* she seems to want to play a lot more and will slide out of my lap when I try to feed her more-as if she's too full, but hasn't eaten as much as she normally does.

She **doesn't**

 cough or sneeze more than a regular random sneeze or cough
* run a fever
* fight sleep--she let's us know when she's tired and will easily go down for a nap
She'll still sleep through the night and her first nap is usually between 10-11am, she'll sleep anywhere from 1-3 hours, wake up for awhile and then anytime between 3-5pm she'll go down for an hour or two and then be up til bedtime which is anywhere between 8:30-9:30pm. She seems to be up a little more than usual before her first nap (I guess I don't see that as not normal at this age) and she's starting to fight her second naps, but it's obvious when she gets tired enough for one.
Or maybe like the title suggests, I'm just paranoid and she's just wanting to play more and not give a crap about much else. We've been extremely lucky with her not being sick even once *knock on wood*. So all advice and tips and/or tricks are appreciated.

"So, starting last week my 8 week old son has decided that every night between 9pm and 2am he is going to cry. We are able to get him to stop for a few minutes at a time and sometimes for the whole night, but last night was the worst. He was up pretty much the entire night until it was time for my husband and I to get up and go to work. He also had some pretty green poop so I took his temperature which was fine.  
I went ahead and called the doctor to see if I should bring him in. My doctor's nurse called me back. She asked how often he was eating and I replied that he ate every 1-4 hours. She freaked out and told me that eating every hour was too much and basically told me stop feeding him that much. I tried to explain to her that he doesn't always eat every hour, just that sometimes he has a feeding frenzy. She just kept telling me that he was overeating and that I should stop feeding him that often.  
  
Now, I am no expert, but does this seem like a strange thing to tell someone?    
My son is still only 8 weeks old. He isn't overweight at all. He burps during and after feedings (we breast and bottle feed). I just don't think the solution for him to stop crying is to take food away from him. Am I wrong? What should I do? I have an appointment with the doctor for next Wednesday just looking for some input on this information. ",6
"SO, the last few nights have been hell. I wake up with my 3mo baby crying and screaming, tears included, and he even coughs sometimes. Today I saw him chewing his pacifier and then chewing his lip. He wasn't hungry, I tried to feed him but it was just impossible since he just ate. About an hour ago he woke up screaming and crying and there was nothing that would calm him down so I checked if had gas, but nothing happened, I put him in other positions, maybe he was uncomfortable but nope. So I just hugged and talked to him really soft and he calmed down just a bit so my boyfriend made him a bottle (I breastfeed but I had a plugged duct and I produce barely nothing, we're trying to get my supply back) and eventually he fell asleep while drinking it. I checked his gums but I have no idea how it is when a teeth is about to come out but I didn't see anything weird, could it be dentition? What was your experience? Of course I will contact his pediatrician tomorrow morning. TL;DR: baby is crying all night since last week and I think it could be dentition but I'm not sure.",6
"So, to make a long story short, I don't make enough milk for my little man. For mamas who have been through this and continued to nurse what they did produce, how long were you able to continue nursing? We are nursing at every feeding (well, not when I'm at work, but I pump for his feedings then), and then he gets a bottle with formula. My goal when he was born was to breastfeed exclusively for 6 months (HA!), then breastfeed at least until his birthday. Now, I'm kinda planning on going until I can't anymore....assuming it will be less than a year. Just wondering what others have gone through... Oh, and BTW--I have worked with a lactation consultant, my physician, and my son's pediatrician... we have done everything suggested to increase my milk supply, what we get is what I am capable of making. I'm sure it would be well-meaning, but please don't suggest another way for me to try to increase my supply. Trust me, I did everything they suggested and I still have a ton of guilt with not be able to make enough to feed my little boy. :)",6
"So, we hired a part-time babysitter who was hired to come by three times a week.  The first week, she came for two days as a sort of trial run while our baby's grandma was still in town to help ease in the transition.
Last week was to be her first full 3-day week (MTTh), but she had to miss the Monday due to a medical emergency.  So, Tuesday, things started pretty rough, but by the day's end the babysitter and our daughter were finally able to play alone together.  But feeding and sleeping still required assistance from my wife.  Two days later, it seemed like our baby needed to get re-acquainted again and was distrusftul of the babysitter, requiring my wife to handle (or assist) most of the feedings and cradling her to sleep.
This week, we went a few more steps backwards with our 7-month-old still not completely warming up to her.   The babysitter was able to feed the baby, but only if we're in the same room.  And since last week, my wife has been convinced that the babysitter needs to be let go.  Today.
I'd like to at least give the babysitter a few more days, but I'm wondering what others have done in this situation.  Do they let their baby cry it out and let the babysitter figure out how to console their kid on his or her own?   I'm actually okay with this, but more than a half-minute of crying drives my wife nuts, and doesn't think any further crying is good for the baby.  (Something tells me that if we're not more patient, we're just going to go through the same cycle of evaluating a babysitter for four or five days and then fire her.)  
Btw, I think our daughter banks on the fact that we're not far away, and she'll just cry until my wife or me (when I'm home) comes to the rescue.  
I think what we also have going against us is the fact that our daughter doesn't see the babysitter all that often.  There're four days between Thursday and Monday, and that's long enough for our daughter to kind of forget about the babysitter and feel threatened when they meet.   
Thoughts?",6
"So, we tried our LO on solids just a few days before her 6 month birthday because she was so interested in our food.  We tried her on oat cereal, which she loved and strawberries, bananas etc. etc.  We tried beef but that didn't fly.
One day a few weeks ago, she ate her usual 2 tbsp of oat cereal, then vomited it up.  She retched until her tummy was empty.  We thought maybe the bananas we had put in the oat cereal were bad and that she had food poisoning, but she was fine after her tummy was empty and went back to the breast.  
Ever since then, she will not eat any solids.  She'll have maybe a tsp of fruits or veg but she will not touch the cereals at all.  The only non-boobie food device she'll accept is her frozen strawberries in the mesh bag dealie for teething.  
Have you mommies ever had this happen?  Is it a phase?  I hope so because I am looking forward to having normal sized breasts in 6 months or so....",2
"So, when baby boy was small and not mobile i could easily read books to him, point out things, etc. 
Since mobility happened, the reading has decreased because he wants to eat and/or destroy the books. I get babies want to touch and turn the pages and even want to close the books. But i want to have a healthy reading relationship with my son. 
Does anyone else's little tyke turn into a Tasmanian Devil at the site of paper or like to chew of pieces of boardbooks?
How did you work story time into the rambunctious antics? 
I would really love to make this parr of his bedtime routine.",6
"Some back story to start off...I was in the Navy for 12 years, the last 3 of which were spent in Virginia.  I was involuntarily separated (downsized) from the Navy this year and had to relocate to Texas to start a new job. My son had a great group of friends in Virginia and all of us parents hung out and got along real well. Due to some bad circumstances we no longer communicate with a large portion of that group, and my son cannot communicate with his old friends because of this. 
Now to the present...My son started school at the end of August and is having a really tough time making friends.  We live in a large community and all of the kids go to one of 2 elementary schools. This being the case, a lot of them know each other already and have their own little groups of friends. My son feels like an outsider, and seems really down and depressed at times. It pains me to see him like this. He's usually such a happy kid. Does anyone have any advice they could offer to help us through this?
TL;DR Had to move for work and son is lonely and depressed.
Update: Just wanted to let you all know that we made it out this past weekend to hang out with some neighbors who have kids around my son's age.  They all played great together, and my son seemed normal"" for the weekend. We'll have to see how the school week goes",6
"Some background: My daughter is starting first grade at a charter school where the children pack their lunch 4 days a week (Fridays are pizza days).  My daughter is a picky eater, and peanut butter is not allowed due to several children who have peanut allergies in her grade.  I want to pack healthy lunches with as much variety as possible, but in ways that she is sure to enjoy.  
Any suggestions?  I pack things like frozen yogurt tubes and a variety of fruits, but am having difficulty getting her to eat proteins and veggies.  Also, links to any helpful sites for recipes would be appreciated.",2
"Some history: Up until 3 months of age, my son was pretty good at getting to sleep. I'd need to rock him in his bassinet occasionally, or just stay with him and shush him for a bit, but he was pretty good. He would wake 3-4 times during the night to have the dummy put back in, but was generally okay. 
Then at about 4 months he started waking in the night and being awake for a whole hour, and wanting to play.
Now from about 5 months he's becoming harder and harder to get to sleep. Last night was about 40 minutes of straight crying, no matter what I did. The only thing that worked was to pick him up, but I try to avoid doing that as much as possible. Last night when I did he vomited, I think from crying too much. I would rock him in his cot, and he'd be happy for a few seconds, then let out a couple of horrific cries, then go back to being happy again. He'll pull the dummy out and then cry that its not in, and he's now waking just about every hour overnight for the dummy. He does go straight back to sleep afterwards putting it back in, and he isn't hungry (he's dropped his overnight bottle pretty consistently for a week or two now).
Two of his naps today he did the same thing, and my wife was in tears when I got home because she gets so stressed when he cries.
We've read lots of books, and there are so many settling techniques, but none of them seem to mention anything about when you actually put him to sleep, and will not stop crying, they seem to be more about the waking during the night.
We don't want to do any kind of cry-it-out solution, but that seems to be the last thing we haven't tried. Besides the fact that he's too young for it though, I don't think its worth the physical and emotional stress it puts my wife under.
Sorry for the rambling nature of this, but I don't think I can quite formulate things into words properly. In about 5 minutes I'll be bathing him and feeding him and putting him to bed, so the dread is starting to set in for the evening...
---More info: We have a very strict evening routine of bath, feed, sleep. Its been working very well, and he knows that its bed time when it happens. We have night time music we have played whilst feeding and putting to bed for months, and for the last few weeks we've extended this to play every night.
This evening I did the usual stuff, he fell asleep for a few seconds while I fed him, but woke up as I put him down. Still sleepy, but awake. I said goodnight and left the room, and about 5 minutes later he started screaming. I went in, rocked, shushed etc, and he didn't really stop for a good 20 minutes, despite me being there the whole time, except when i picked him up to see if he needed burping. At 8:15ish he was quiet again so I left the room, and since then every 10-15 minutes he's screamed, I've gone back to rock and shush him, which now calms him right down, and then i leave the room again. I think he's asleep for these 10-15 minutes, but wakes up, possibly without the dummy, possibly in pain, possibly just without me, and screams.
Part of me wonders if this is completely normal behaviour for a 5 month old baby, and if there aren't parents out there who think we were spoiled rotten before, and now just dealing with normality, but most of me thinks that I can't stand my wife feeling physically ill having to listen to our little boy cry, and having her dread every nap tomorrow when I'm at work.
I'm not really sure what I am expecting typing all of this out. I think we're just at a loss as to what to do, and neither of us can deal with our child crying uncontrollably for much longer.
**TL;DR: How do I get my son to go to go to sleep better**",6
"Sometimes I wonder if my stepmom has ever even seen a baby or child. She is just *scandalized* by their noise and messes. The concept that a toddler is a little scientist/explorer who experiments with gravity and nature has never occurred to her. Every time my (13 mos) son throws food off his high chair (this is at my house) she needs to make some little comment to me, like as a parent I should know how to correct the behavior. And what's weird is, she's an artist who goes out into the woods and smears mud on trees and stacks rocks into cairns. But my goodness, MY STARS, Caroline has strewn the dirt from the planter all over the sidewalk. She said the following to my niece yesterday:
Now Caroline I wasn't around to hear this  but I would have said something. My brother didn't say anything because his contempt for her is too great to justify an argument or to clean it up themselves. It's another to shame and gender-essentialize them like a fucking Victorian prick. Okay I'm done. Thank you. UPDATE: This morning my niece was singing a song about her vagina. Stepmom: ""What is she saying?!"" Me: ""She's singing about her vagina."" Stepmom: ""At this age? Should she be talking about that?"" Me: ""It's normal for 2- and 3-year-olds to talk about their body parts. Especially because they're potty training  so it goes along with teaching them to wipe themselves and all that."" Stepmom: [shakes head] ""If you say so...""""",6
"Sometimes it feels like my 2 1/2 year old son could out-eat me. Lately, his breakfasts have consisted of:
* A Bowl of Cereal
* A piece of fruit (usually a banana or half an apple)
* A container of yogurt.
Not one of these... ALL THREE!
So what do your kids eat?

"Sooo long story short, bi-polar mom, rocky relationship, I would rather not talk to her at all but feel super bad about it. Then I had a baby and she decided to move to my town. (Only seen her about once a year for the last 6-7 years, which I was perfectly fine with.)
Anyhow she made us dinner Christmas eve and I managed to drag my husband over there, and we had an alright time, very carefully. I've been taking the baby over there about once a week, cause it's really all I can handle. She came over here once but my husband does not want her at our house. I haven't told her that, just make up reasons for us to visit her, like wanting to see her new house or bring her something or whatever. 
I went to visit her again on the 29th. While I was there I realized I was hating every minute of it, her holding my baby makes me nervous, stupid stuff. I think I only go there to make her happy. But then I went to leave and she picked up the carseat with my daughter in it and I went to take it to walk to the car and she was like no I didn't really give a shit who carried the baby to the car. But in that moment I really realized I was still afraid of her at 26 (no physical abuse but just soo much yelling  she gets like stormy and belligerent and terrifying when she's angry Then yesterday she texted me a picture of a toy she got for baby. I responded and said it was cute and that baby had got her shots today and had a fever and was sad. (This was true. She got her 4 month check yesterday Here's the texts: Me: Oh nice very cute! She had shots today Mom: Ahh! Nice they get over it so fast ! I would like to see you  Me: She's probably going to have a fever and be kind of inconsolable for a couple days like last time. We'll come visit when she feels better.  Mom: Oh yes I'm sure it's something  Mom: I'm here and would like to see my granddaughter and you as well  Mom: When you decide let me know  Mom: I can always come there if you decide to invite me  Mom: I love you and am here if you need me and also if you don't  Mom: Would like her to at least know who I am  All within 2 minutes of each other while I was in the kitchen getting some food going. Is this like super passive aggressive or am I just really defensive now?? This is the same woman who asked me to get up and get her some water while she held my baby a day after my c-section I just want to be done though. Finally making an appointment with a counselor because my daughter is finally a good enough reason to get myself some help.

"Sorry for a bit of wall o'text and an often brought up topic.

My son is 3 1/2 months old, almost 2 months adjusted and EBF and feeds on demand.  
I searched up on various sleeping schedule, but nothing really explained for a preemie.
Whenever age is the target age, should I always follow his adjusted age or his actual age?  I understand that I should follow his adjusted age for developmental milestones and percentiles, but what about sleeping (and solid food for that matter)?
From what I've read is 6 months is a good time to really start a set routine and baby should sleep through the night, and be able to self soothe without Mommy and Daddy.
My pediatrician have mentioned that the earlier I break a habit, the better. So I'm working on adjusting things, and would like your advice.  
What time should a baby start going through time for bed "" routine?    I'm learning to pop him off the breast once comfort nursing gets too long so I can put him to his playpen easier.  I did this twice and tonight he slept for 4 hours in playpen...that's the longest he slept in there without being right next to me. He usually flails and kick and crying like crazy once I move him after a long comfort nursing session and I end up having him sleep on my chest.  I am working on weaning him off that for night time. I have no problems with him comfort nursing for naps Sorry if its a little discombobulated.  EDIT: thanks for the two insights I feel better.  I really need to trust my gut and just go with the flow.  I'm a structured type of gal",6
"Sorry for any spelling/grammar errors, im on my phone and super tired. 
My son and I just flew back to the east coast of the United States from a month long visit with my family in Australia (which has an 11 hour time difference, almost exactly the opposite) on Wednesday and despite attempts over the last few days to flip his sleep schedule my son is staying up all night and wanting to sleep all day. 
So far trying to keep him awake during the day results in an extremely unhappy baby. He doesn't want to eat more than a little bit of solids, only to nurse for every meal, which of course causes him to fall asleep. He is hitting me, pulling hair, throwing things and not listening (i can't blame him, coz I'm feeling pretty cranky myself) and he's very clingy. 
Yesterday I woke him after four hours into what would be his overnight"" sleep (which is usually 10-11 hours) to try and restart his schedule and kept him up until 7:30pm  except a short 30 min nap while he nursed There is not much I can do to keep him quiet over night and my husband works long hours so i hate to have the baby disturbing his sleep.

As we were getting ready to order dinner. SO felt that the baby is getting a little fussy... So he decided to call it a night and go home with her. It was almost bed time for her and we were a good 45-50 min drive away from home. I thought nothing of it, but once he left few ppl behaved as if SO was wrong in leaving and being asocial.

"Sorry for the wall of text, but I could really use some insight. My dear, sweet wife wants kids and she wants them now. I used to feel the same way, but the reality of living with her depression has taken a lot of the wind out of my sails. 
My wife's depression is chronic, and comes in predictable cycles. In the 11 years that we have been together I have watched her fall into 2-3 deep depressions a year, with each one usually lasting between 2-4 months. During these depressions she is selfish, unkind, and very hard to life with, despite how much I love her. Medication seems to stop the cycles from my perspective, but she swears they just make her numb, not better. As of now she is in therapy twice a week and it does seem to be helping her cope with the cycles without taking them out on me, but they are still happening regularly. She says she will not go on meds again. 
Here is where parenting comes in: My wife has depression cycles no matter what, but certain triggers seem to make her depression much, much worse. These trigger are:
* Noise in the home. I like to have music or TV on most of the time as background noise. We have learned that even this low level noise greatly increases her anxiety. 
* Conflict. Something as simple as me wanting Mexican food and her wanting Italian will upset her for days. If we have an actual fight where anyone's voice is raised (including if she yells at me and I don't react) she is upset for weeks. 
* Felling trapped in a schedule outside of work. If I ask her what she wants to do on Saturday that is a trigger. Any planning during her off hours increases her anxiety. 
* Negative social interactions. When people are rude to each other around her she flips, spirals, and is worse for days. These interactions can be very minor. For example, one co-worker saying something negative about another co-worker. 
It seems to me that each of my wife's trigger buttons is going to be being pushed 24/7 once we have a kid in the house. To my dismay, she seems to be in denial about these things. For example, if I try to talk to her about how kids are loud or messy, or require a ridged schedule of school pick ups and extra curriculars she says I'm being negative (put a check next to trigger #4.) She genuinely seems to think of parenting as a Norman Rockwell painting filled only with snuggles and eager young things ready to give you love in exchange for life lessons. I'm terrified that once we do have kids she is going to be in for the mother of all crashes, and I honestly don't think she can handle it. I see myself raising the children alone as more likely than her getting through it. 
Am I being overly negative? Have any of you been in a situation similar to this? Any tips of ideas as to how to convey the reality of kids to her? Do any of you who now have kids deal with similar depression triggers? ",6
"Sorry if this has already been asked but... We have an almost 3 year old (in Feb) who will no sit down to eat. She will fight us on every meal sit down eat one bite jump up and leave the table, then come back take another piece and head off again. If we try to force her to sit and eat it's a fight but I can't take this type of meal eating anymore. I don't want to take away her food since she eats so little already that I don't want her loosing weight.

"Sorry in advance for the wall of text. I need to get all this off my chest. I feel like I am drowning in my life right now. Every morning when I wake up, and every night before I go to sleep, I am trying to think of a way out, and I come up with nothing. I feel like a caged animal. My little boy is 8 months old now and growing fast. I love him dearly but we have our struggles, mostly centered around sleep right now. I am still co-sleeping with him for at least part of the night, because I am too weak at 2 a.m. to get him back down in his crib and I just give up and bring him into bed with me. Because of this, my boyfriend has not slept in our bed since we came home from the hospital. He does not agree with my decision to co-sleep. We have not had sex or anything even remotely close since before the baby was born. Part of this is logistical - the baby's room is right next to our room with just a half-wall separating them so there is really no privacy. And, not to be blunt, but we don't really have any other furniture that's conducive to sexytimes. It's always been the bed or nothing. I am up to my ears at work with stress and being busy. Things were bad before I had the kid, but for a variety of reasons they have gotten way worse. I have been asked to put in a lot of overtime and work evenings and weekends, which has put a huge stress on my relationship with my boyfriend. He is angry that I'm being asked to work so much when we have a little baby at home, and even though he says he's not mad at me, I still feel his anger and it makes me feel helpless. If I quit my job, we will all lose our health insurance and I wont' be able to make my mortgage payments. I don't think I could easily sell, or even rent, my house because we're in the middle of renovations. Oh yeah, renovations. So I don't have working kitchen right now (hot plate and microwave, no dishwasher) so we are eating lots of convenience foods, which means spending way more money than I am used to on groceries, and also I do not feel like it's helping me eat healthy and lose the baby weight that I am still carrying around. Which makes me feel like crap physically. My relationship with my boyfriend has degenerated to the point where we barely speak. At this point I don't even really know what's going on. I don't know if we're both just exhausted and stressed out, or if one day he is just going to come home and say, I can't do this anymore"" and leave us. That is my biggest fear.†I am as guilty as he is. When I get home from work I feel totally drained. †I feel like my BF does not even notice or care.†We do not have any friends. I am friendly with a few people at work †but †have never socialized with them outside the office. It feels like they live in a different world from me. Even if I did want to get together with someone. My BF's mom has offered to baby-sit †and has watched our little guy a few times. We're falling behind financially. My BF is also working a lot of hours to try to make up the difference †but I look at what's coming in and what's going out and it is not adding up. Fortunately we have money saved up I know I should talk to my BF about all this †but I am so tired of trying to start conversations like this and just getting shut down. 'i cannot show him what I have written here without hi being deeply offended that I posted this here (he is a Redditor and this is a throwaway account). Every night when I go to put the baby down for bed I keep asking myself if this is depression. But I honestly don't think it is. I do not think I would feel this way if there was just some part of my life right now that did not make me feel sick to my stomach to think about.†TL;DR: I feel like everything in my life sucks and I don't know what to do.†",6
"Sorry to bother you guys with this wall of text, but I recently became an uncle, and I'm not sure if I'm being overzealous or if my concerns are valid. 
My sister-in-law and her boyfriend just had their baby two weeks ago, an accident. All through the pregnancy they fought, both of them (especially him) didn't seem too enthusiastic about the whole thing or took very good of her health. They lived in filth the entire time, no matter how we and the rest of her family tried to help. Dishes piled up and moldy, laundry never done, black mold growing in the bathroom. 
But in the last month they seemed to turn it around, cleaned up the apartment, she started eating healthy. Both of them seemed so happy! When the little girl was born, their place was clean and baby-ready and he was proud and made little baby announcements. 
Then three days passed and they both stopped caring. By the next week they had stopped cleaning entirely. Sister-in-law stopped eating well and so her milk has become undernourished. Boyfriend is a butcher, comes home in his work clothes with meat contaminates and just sits on the couch holding the baby without cleaning up. 
Three weeks in, baby is skinny, the place is filthy (garbage bags full, rotting food in the fridge, flies, moldy dishes) we've had to buy them baby supplies because she is broke and he won't buy them. There's garbage all over the place, mold in the bathroom is back, laundry hasn't been done since the baby was born. We're really worried for the baby's immune system. 
We know about post-partum and taken that into consideration, but th dad isn't keeping his end up either. He's bought nothing for this baby and clearly didnt want her before she was born. They're both young, they're both only together because of the baby. We're not sure what to do at this point. My wife and I are considering offering to take the baby in, but are worried about insulting them. We don't want to call in CPS because they're family, but this can't keep up. They're living in a situation that's unfit for adults, much less 3-week-olds. We've talked to them and they insist they're just tired/busy and they'll clean soon. We've offered help and they insist they can do it on their own. She's gotten snippy and told us to not bring it up anymore.  I'm worried they're lettin their pride get in the way of seeing the problem. 
Tl;dr newborn niece's parents don't clean, apartment is disgusting and the baby is losing weight because the mother isn't eating well. We're concerned but dont want to interfere in a way that hurts the family. 
So we're not sure where to go from here. Any suggestions? ",6
"Straight and to the point, for the most part.
19430,
19431,1.) Our daughter rarely eats. She has her bottles at nap time, her sippy cups through the day, but she doesn't like to eat. She just plays w/ her food when it's given to her. After watching her a bit, she'll take food in her hand, sort of play w/ it, but tosses it down because, I feel, she doesn't like the texture. We've tried to make up for this by supplying her w/ nutritional drinks that contain all of the nutrients we believe her body needs, but still dislike that she plain out will not eat food. Is this a possible norm or is there a possibility there is something wrong?
19432,
19433,2.) Due to a hectic lifestyle - me on the personal side and my S/O on the work and college side, out toddler doesn't have the chance to go out much, nor do we live close to anyone that she could actually interact and play w/. While I do not like her watching TV all day, on some days it is almost too cold lately to go outside. (Michigan) Should we be alarmed and are we doing anything wrong...?",2

"Technically, I'm not supposed to be on this subreddit until at least the 23rd, but I find that the women on this sub are a lot more level-headed than bumpers so this is going in /r/mommit instead of /r/babybumps. Also this is more than likely going to be very long, but I promise it's a legitimate problem that I need advice on. For starters, my SO and I are 19 and 18, respectively. We live with our parents, but we both work full-time and he's in school for engineering, so we're not a couple of bums who feed off of mommy and daddy. This pregnancy was not planned and has not been easy on us, but we're making it work as best we can. Through the support of our loved ones and the support we get from each other, we're doing alright. There's just one problem-- my mom. My mother and father divorced when I was 15 because my dad was having an extramarital affair. Before you guys go sympathizing with my mom, I want you to know that they hated each other for years, my earliest memories are running to my room to get out of the way of them fighting. I can recall being in elementary school and asking my friends if it was normal for parents to throw things at each other (the answer was always 'no'). Even though having someone cheat on you is a blow to your self-esteem and undoubtedly a very rough thing to go through, my mother has dramatized the situation and even though it happened 3 years ago, it's as though it happened last week. I tell this story because she blames her (bad) behavior on my father. Back to the problem at hand. Mom regularly has what I call 'mean attacks' where she will verbally put me down in every way possible and act recklessly and unreasonably for a period of time. These episodes are completely out of nowhere and can last anywhere from an afternoon to a weekend. She never apologizes, she just kind of snaps out of it. Honestly I got used to it because it's been happening for as long as I can remember, but ever since I've been pregnant she has taken it a step further and will insult my unborn child and SO. That shit hurts. I'm not even going to go into specifics about what she says because it pains me to repeat it. Recently, she's gotten on this 'mean attack' because my SO's mom offered to have a small baby shower for us. I don't know why, but it pissed her off. After going through her routine of chewing me out, she called my mother in law and started on her. Of course my MIL didn't take it and argued back, but now I'm getting all of this backlash from my mom and it's stressing me out really bad and I don't know what I should do/how much more I can take. It's obviously stressing out my SO as well because he doesn't want to see his mom screamed at for no reason. I'm becoming very depressed, when I'm not at work or with my SO I literally do nothing all day because I feel like shit. So, mommit, help me out here-- what can I do? **TL;DR- mom is insane and it's driving everyone else insane and I don't know what the hell to do**",6
"Thanks everyone who answered my previous post about clinginess, discipline, sleep and food habits. I have a new one.
I‚Äôm starting with a bit of background that might be unrelated, but I just want to rule out any connections.
---
My 15 month old caught a cold 3 weeks back, and it infected me and my bro, and we had it very bad. My son was okay in 2-3 days, but I took 2 weeks to be better. 
The Saturday before last, he scooped up some water from a neighbor‚Äôs toilet, and I suspect he drank it; he had poured it all over himself. He seemed totally fine after that, no diarrhea, and the doc said he should be fine. It‚Äôs been more than a week.
---
**Friday, he was running a temperature** of 101.7, we picked him up from the daycare at 4 and gave him Tylenol, and the fever slowly reduced on Saturday, and he seemed fine and energetic on Sunday.  But he did seem to have very liquidy mucusy **diarrhea**, it kinda looked like urine, but was light brown / orange, and fully soaked through the diaper, nothing remained on top except a bit of mucus. **Farts were smelly after that, and he did not poop till Monday evening. Not sure if the monday evening poop was diarrhea** , it was kinda smooth n pasty, most of it must have been absorbed by the diaper, but no visible mucus.
From Friday evening, **I‚Äôd been breastfeeding him lots, and not giving him much solids,** he was refusing solids anyway, and breast milk would be easier to digest. Trouble was, I had stopped pumping in the daytime on weekdays, so **my body probably was not making enough milk **for breastfeeding him the whole day. 
I also was **unintentionally dehydrating myself** because I wanted to only drink filtered water to avoid another bad case of the cold, and the Brita pitcher was just not fast enough for me.  I woke up in the middle of the night on Sunday with a very dry throat and my son crying, so I drank water and tried to feed him but he refused my milk and screamed, he refused water with honey in it, and only calmed down when I tried a folk remedy of massaging coconut oil on his belly.
He started crying again in the morning, so I immediately took him to his pediatrician, where the RN told me he was **probably recovering from a stomach bug, and probably was crying in the night because he was dehydrated,** since that morning the diaper was brown with urine and smelly. She said his ears and throat were fine, his fever was gone, and the rash he had on Sunday is common after a fever. She recommended pedialite and yoghurt. My son did not like much of yoghurt, and he had a little bit of the pedialyte here and there, but mostly would try to drool it out of his mouth.  After dinner he refused even that. I did the mistake of giving him regular table food (saut√©ed beans with cumin and coriander powder), and I suspect it might have been hard on his tummy.
Tonight he started crying again, and I was again dry, so I drank water, **still he refused my milk, refused pedialyte, did not like to be held, patted, massaged, disturbed in any way**. I let him sleep in my arms and dropped about 20 ml of pedialyte in his mouth with medicine filler, along with some chamomile tea. I drank some pedialyte too, cause I thought my breast milk might taste funny if I don‚Äôt have enough electrolytes.
He‚Äôs sleeping fine now, probably due to the chamomile. 
**What exactly is going on? Why does he only cry in the night, and why does he refuse my breast milk even when I can make it**? His penis seems fine, no redness, only the scrotum seemed too wrinkly when he was was probably dehydrated.
Thanks for reading, and I‚Äôm indebted for any input, especially since the doctor could not help me on this.
EDIT:
He had one wet diaper in the middle of the day on Monday. Also was smacking his tongue, so I guess it was dry, and the little pedialyte he had in the daytime did not help him.
I was downing lots of water plus eating milk boosting stuff, so I thought I was making enough for him, but I was wrong.
He slept well after this post, probably the combo of 20 ml pedialyte, chamomile, and me drinking pedialyte eased him into sleep.",6

"thats pretty much it, my 7 week old is losing it every time he poops. possibly food related (EBF) ? or just regular digestion development? It's really bad loud inconsolable crying. btw he's only pooping weekly, between 5-8 days apart (i heard that was normal from my pediatrician though)

That's pretty much it. He refuses to eat dinner most nights and then wakes up the next morning starving. It doesn't even seem to matter what I make. Thoughts?,2
"The Background
---I am attempting to help parents easily spend time with their children.  There are days for me when I want to do something with my child, but I can‚Äôt think of anything.  There are times when he is watching television and I am on the computer and I think, I should do something with him"" but I don't.  And I feel a little bad.  Don't get me wrong I had seen other websites out there which allow parents to print off activities  but they are mostly just coloring pages
The Idea---So  I had an idea.  I know a few early childhood educators  and maybe I could help them out. I am looking to help parents by combining a ""pull"" - the parents can determine which kind of activities to perform  with a ""push"" - I will send the parent the activities through the mail and the parent will do one a day.  There is little energy used by the parent figuring out what to do for the night (which risks defaulting to passive activities like television[1]) 
The Plan---The idea is to have many different activities such as math  reading I am asking some of the other parenting subbreddits for suggestions and guidance as well.  Ultimately  I am here to give parents what they want.  If the majority of people who sign up for the service want certain features
The Request---If you are interested  send me a PM or follow the above link to let me know you want something like this.  If you have any questions 
The TL;DR ---Interested in an arrangement where you pick five activities for your child and I send you a weekly packet of those five activities that can take 60 minutes to complete ‚Äì allowing you to spend an easy hour each weekday interacting with your child instead of possibly watching television?  Let me know!
---[1] Research suggests that children watch 3-4 hours of television a day on average  and that they should watch no more than 2 per day.  I understand the main reason is that parents are either busy or do not have the energy to think of a game to play with their child
---EDIT: Working on it  but it'll be slow going.  Thanks for the feedback and signups!  I'll let you know what's going on when we get up and running.""",6
The doc gave me the okay to feed my daughter (9 months) pretty much everything. I have an issue with this because I'm so afraid of her choking. She has her two bottom teeth and has a top one coming in. Can anyone give me a guide to giving her more food that's not pureed?,2
"The drive home from our four year old's daycare is about 15 minutes, and it's just before supper time so he's always quite hungry.  Sometimes he gets quite demanding asking for food or drink... he'll even cry sometimes!  Yesterday my wife launched a preemptive strike with feigned fury:**Boy:** I'm hungry!**Mom:** *Do you see a fridge in the car? Do you see a cupboard in the car? Where am I going to find a snack in the car? Is there a snack in the car? We're in the car, there's no food in the car!***Boy:** (Laughs because it's funny when you put your parents in a fit.)
The drive went on with him more or less content.  About ten minutes later he forgot the resolution and decided to remind us of his hunger again.
**Boy:** I'm hungry!
**Mom:** Come on Boy, we're almost home. We'll get you something to eat right away.
**Boy:** NO! I'm hungry NOW!
**Mom:** (Kind of agitated now) That's it.  You know we don't have any food in the car AND that you'll get a snack before dinner when we get home.  If you yell or cry any more you're going to your room.
**Boy:** *Do you see my room in the car?*
Touche boy, touche.",1
"The early days of introducing my baby boy Charlie to solid food was tense, trying and tearful ‚Äì and that was just me. 
Being baby number one for my husband and I, we were both under the illusion that the world of hard food introduction would be relatively pain-free and even downright fun (oh so na√Øve!). And for some babies it is, but the early weeks and months after Charlie turned six-months-old were a bit of a battleground. I cooked and prepared everything I could possibly think of within the ‚Äòsafe for baby to eat‚Äô realm, but let‚Äôs just say my freezer ended up being overtaken by single-portion size plastic containers. A lot of which still sit in there hopefully, waiting to be devoured. I too dream of that day, plastic containers‚Ä¶
Fast forward 2.5 months and mealtime has slowly become easier as I learn what Charlie enjoys and let go of any preconceptions that I had about baby food and what he ‚Äòshould‚Äô be eating at this stage. Charlie also pumped out eight teeth in a two month period so he didn‚Äôt have a great time of it for awhile there. 
I‚Äôve put together the following list of eight foods that Charlie loves (currently). While it‚Äôs not quite the extensive list that many a baby food cookbook author would have you believe that babies will eat by now ‚Äì but perhaps a tad more realistic for some babies. 
*Disclaimer: I know there are babies out there who will happily chow down anything and everything put in front of them and to mums of those babies I say, I hate you! Not really ‚Äì I say congratulations, but this article probably isn‚Äôt for you. 
*Another disclaimer: I still regularly feed Charlie baby food out of a packet (shock! horror!) because basically, he loves the shit out of a handful of vegetable and fruit combinations and they still contain a lot more nutrition than giving him another flippin‚Äô rusk. Again, if you are overtly anti-baby food from a packet, well, I don‚Äôt really care.  
In no particular order, ‚Äò8 Foods That My Fussy Baby Loves‚Äô:
1. Banana: Mashed, made into wedges for little hands to hold onto and blended ‚Äì the humble banana rocks in my humble opinion. 
2. Avocado: Its creamy but subtle flavour has become another staple in my bub‚Äôs small but growing eating repertoire.
Interestingly, banana and avocado blended together is delicious (did someone say, cake batter?). Sometimes I blend those two goodies together with either a boiled egg OR some cottage cheese. A great protein-packed meal that Charlie will eat every morsel of, every time.

3. Cheese: With cheese-loving parents, of course bub was always going to be a cheese worshipper. Currently Charlie is enjoying some cubes of cheddar quite regularly; again another protein and calcium rich gem.
4. Oats: While Charlie doesn‚Äôt exactly wolf his rolled oats down of a morning, he does have at least half a dozen (baby) spoonfuls, which makes me happy as I imagine the complex carbohydrates filling his little belly and giving him energy for the day ahead. 
5. Watermelon: Once you get past the fact that your bub will get the sticky watermelon juice EVERYWHERE ‚Äì you‚Äôll realize what a great fruit it is for bubs‚Äô diet ‚Äì full of hydration and Vitamin C. I‚Äôve been putting wedges of watermelon in Charlie‚Äôs mesh baby feeder (this type of thing), since he first started solids and he loves it a lot. It‚Äôs worth the 10 minutes of cleaning required following a session with said watermelon.
6. Light rye bread: Toasted and spread with avocado or cottage cheese or margarine and Vegemite (yes we‚Äôre Aussies), Charlie seems to enjoy the texture and challenge of holding onto the wedges of toast. And it keeps him amused for longer than 10 minutes ‚Äì win! 

7. Nanny‚Äôs chicken and vegetable casserole: No matter how often I try it, using the same ingredients and technique, my mum‚Äôs casserole always tastes 1,000 times better! It must be some secret nanna ingredient that I ain‚Äôt got. Mum (and I in my futile attempts), put chicken breast, carrot, potato, beans and sweet potato  in a slow cooker for up to eight hours (adding a packet of frozen spinach and some pasta for the last hour). By then the meat and veggies are perfect for using the stick blender on. The confronting green colour that it becomes has surprisingly not deterred Charlie from consuming this delicious meal. Sometimes my husband and I are even disappointed when he eats it all because we wanted some of it. 

8. Tuna: This is a very recent addition to the list. I‚Äôve started buying small tins of tuna in springwater and once drained, mash the flakes with a spoon. It‚Äôs still slowly, slowly at this stage, but Charlie is taking small, consistent nibbles ‚Äì another massive win in my book. 
Of course there are also other foods that Charlie enjoys but let‚Äôs face it, eight is a great number so I‚Äôll leave it at that. I look forward to the day when I can write ‚Äò800 foods that Charlie enjoys‚Äô. 
For any mums like me out there looking for some solidarity and confirmation that they‚Äôre not the only mum in the universe to have a fussy-eating baby, please know that yes, we do exist! 
Baby food recipe books and articles often explain introducing solids in a perfunctionary tone when in reality it can be a highly emotional time.  You worry that your baby‚Äôs not getting the nutrition they need; you worry that they‚Äôll never sleep through the night; you worry about what others will think of your fussy-eating baby; and you‚Äôre frustrated with the time and food wasted on meals that are spat out or never even tried. Just know that mums the world over are going through the same thing. 
In the spirit of this parenting challenge, tell me, was your baby a fussy eater? How did it make you feel? What kinds of foods and things worked for you when introducing your baby to solid food? I‚Äôd love to hear both your challenges and successes. 
Yours in endless pureeing,

I kid you not, the day after he started eating.  It was just a little breakfast, and I gave him praise and all of that mushy stuff.  The day after?  The little man was just waddling and happy with food in his mouth.  He didn't fuss or throw his food when I put him in his chair, he just ate his food and went on his merry.
I kept his appointment with the pediatrician and still brought up his eating habits, along with the use of pedialyte.  What I didn't mention in the last post is that he loves pedialyte, and would drink it like it was kool-aid.  She basically said that pedialyte was fine because of the electrolytes, and that he'd suffer more damage if he drank water too much.  Something about water overdose?  Anyways, she said he was healthy aside from an ear infection, which I didn't even notice he had because.. he's just a cheery little thing.
From then on up until now, he's been eating.  I've steamed foods like everyone suggested and used fruits, he' a HUGE fan of mashed potatoes, I mush bananas for him and skim apples with a spoon for him to eat.  Whenever I have fruit in my hand, he always waddles up and smacks his lips for a bite.  He's just cute, and he's eating, and he's happy.  He isn't a fan of plums or peaches, but I have a whole arsenal of fruits so that really doesn't matter.
I also noticed that he's a huge fan of ramen noodles, creamed corn, and beans.  Also, Gerber juices!  He sucks those puppies back like no ones business!  I have at least one more can of formula left, and I think it's a safe bet to start transitioning him to whole milk.
I don't have any more questions, I think everything is covered from here, but if there is any more food tips to try, I would love, love, love to have them.  But so far, so good, and I thank you guys so much for the advice.  Much love, and happy fathers day!",3

"The other day I was babysitting my two and a half year old niece. My friend and I decided to take her to a local, family friendly restaurant for lunch. Admittedly, she was laughing and giggling a lot and it did get quiet loud at times but in generally I don‚Äôt believe she was a huge burden on the restaurant. Part way through the meal she announces in a loud voice that she needs to pee so I get up to hurry her to the washroom because she is in the middle of being potty trained. When I get up she takes off at a run and yells ‚Äúcatch me Auntie!‚Äù and begins to run through the restaurant. I catch her quickly and start to direct her to the washroom. Suddenly a girl says ‚Äúexcuse me‚Äù from a table I am walking past. I look in her direction and it‚Äôs a woman in her late 20‚Äôs-early 30‚Äôs maybe and a man of about the same age sitting at this table. The woman proceeds to tell me something along the lines of ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt keep that little bastard quiet and under control keep her in the house and don‚Äôt ruin everyone else‚Äôs fucking lunch‚Äù. I was stunned by this. I had no idea how to react and in the end I just kind of stared at her then walked away with my niece. 
Has anyone had to deal with this before? I understand that unruly children at nice restaurants, particularly at dinner time can be irritating but they would have to be REALLY bad for me to even consider saying something polite about it. In this instance it was a nationwide restaurant which advertised itself as family friendly and this was during the lunch hour on a Friday. I was both offended and mortified by this. How do you react to something like this? Personally, it has never occurred to me that someone would have such a volatile reaction to children in restaurants at lunch. I am now wondering if this is a naive perspective on how society actually feels about children. Have you ever faced this? How do you deal with it? Does it affect your desire to bring kids out in public? Does it make you feel self conscious?

"The other day my 2.5 year old daughter and I were having a touching moment. I held her small face in my hands, looked into her eyes, and whispered to her that she was truly beautiful. She looked back into my eyes and solemnly whispered back: I know"".  Of course my first reaction was to smile and laugh and think how adorable she was  but then later I got to thinking about that moment. When I was growing up  to herself or to others. Of course she would tell me that I was beautiful growing up  but I never truly believed her; she was just being kind. In truth  I was a fat kid and given how hard she was on herself for her perceived weight issues  I couldn't see how she could possibly think that I was beautiful. Compliments were given to be nice  not to be sincere. Even after I got myself physically healthy and turned into a strong  capable and beautiful young woman  I swore that I would not berate myself in front of them. I was determined to show them that I was proud of myself  my body my accomplishments (which include having them). I don't want my daughters to learn fake modesty through belittling themselves. I want them to learn true modesty through an understanding of themselves  and through empathy for others. So when my small daughter looked at me and earnestly told me she knew she was beautiful  that's a big moment for me and a reflection that I am proud of!""",6

She was born 16 months ago with half a brain missing (not literally half a brain, but some parts just didn't grow.) There is no official"" prognosis. They say she could stay 5 months old (where is is mentally) or grow up to be a normal adult. Official diagnosis is hydrocephalus with brain anomalies.

"These are a few fairly, easy, quick, and healthy whole family recipes my (moderately fussy) baby loves....**Thai chicken curry**Cut up chicken (I used 400g), fry in a little oil, add garlic.Add chopped aubergine (eggplant), courgette (zuchini), mushrooms (and or whatever soft veg you have lying about). Add a few tablespoons of red curry paste (homemade or from a jar). Fry for a few minutes. Add a tin of coconut milk. Add some frozen peas. Add in some basil and or coriander (cilantro) if you have it. Simmer until thick and creamy (~15 mins). I chop up one portion into small bits as finger food for the baby -he loves it! Then I add a few more table spoons of curry paste for the adult portion.**Creamy roast tomato and Cheese Sauce**Cut some tomatoes in half (also add some sliced red pepper if you have it) drizzle with olive oil, roast at 200\deg for about half an hour. Tip into saucepan over the heat, simmer for 10 mins until reduced blitz with a blender, add some basil and a few table spoons of soft cheese/philadelphia, melt in some of whatever cheese you have lying around (I use loads of cheddar and mozzarella). I serve this with tagliatelle and cooked mixed veg. My baby loves it as finger food.**Chicken with pear and root veg**I chuck some chicken legs or thighs in the crock pot/casserole with some oil and garlic to brown. Add some finely chopped pears and some thickly cut root vegetables (I love carrots, parsnips and sweet potatoes). Add some low salt (or home made if you have it) stock to cover and a few tablespoons of mustard (I use dijon), chuck in some parsley and/or thyme if you have it. Simmer very gently for a few hours until the meat is tender and falling off the bone. I strip the chicken meat from the bone then chop everything up very small for baby's portion. If I have it I chuck in some creme fraiche for the adult portion. **Avocado and cream cheese/cinamon banana on toast**Pretty self explanatory, ripe avocado and cream cheese (or mashed ripe bananas mashed up with cinammon) spread thick on  toast, cut into little bits for the baby. My baby loves it (and so do I).**Baby Parfait**Baby's favorite fruit puree swirled around ricotta (or full fat greek yoghurt) with nutmeg and cinnamon. I'd love to hear more ideas, my baby much prefers grown up food to purees etc but the stuff I used to cook is a little too sweet/salty for the little one.",4
"These are triggered when a high fever spikes.  Our 16 month old had one yesterday.  She didn't even have a fever, and wasn't sick at all when it happened.  The fever came immediately after, and the doctor explained that your body can be hot on the inside before the skin is hot.
Febrile seizures are convulsions brought on by a fever in infants or small children. During a febrile seizure, a child often loses consciousness and shakes, moving limbs on both sides of the body. Less commonly, the child becomes rigid or has twitches in only a portion of the body, such as an arm or a leg, or on the right or the left side only. Most febrile seizures last a minute or two, although some can be as brief as a few seconds while others last for more than 15 minutes.
The majority of children with febrile seizures have rectal temperatures greater than 102 degrees Fahrenheit.
Approximately one in every 25 children will have at least one febrile seizure, and more than one-third of these children will have additional febrile seizures before they outgrow the tendency to have them.
Children rarely develop their first febrile seizure before the age of 6 months or after 3 years of age. The older a child is when the first febrile seizure occurs, the less likely that child is to have more.
A few factors appear to boost a child's risk of having recurrent febrile seizures, including young age (less than 15 months) during the first seizure, frequent fevers, and having immediate family members with a history of febrile seizures. If the seizure occurs soon after a fever has begun or when the temperature is relatively low, the risk of recurrence is higher.
In other words, between 95 and 98 percent of children who experience febrile seizures do not go on to develop epilepsy.  The type of febrile seizure also matters; children who have prolonged febrile seizures (particularly lasting more than an hour) or seizures that affect only part of the body, or that recur within 24 hours, are at a somewhat higher risk. Among children who don't have any of these risk factors, only one in 100 develops epilepsy after a febrile seizure. ",6
"These seems like it would be a no brainer, but it has taken me some time now to really figure it out.

"They are loud; sticky; annoying; hyper; repetitive; in need of too much attention. Growing up as a girl I was always given dolls or water baby's to play with but constantly ditched them for Hot Wheels or a book. As a teenager I watched Mother's dealing with their children in a mall or at a restaurant and I pitied them, I pitied the sleep deprived look in their eyes or the overfilling diaper bags at their sides. Out of all of my eight siblings I was the one everybody believed would never have children, due to a lifelong dislike for them even when I was their ages. Then, unexpectedly, I did. 
During my pregnancy I became reluctantly attached to my growing bump and the little movements inside of myself. I knew, deep in my heart, I wanted her, loved her, before she was here, but I also was terrified of becoming one of those Mother's I used to pity. 
My mind was set that children were a handful I never wanted even after she was born. It didn't change through the hardships of having surgery to birth her, of breastfeeding around the clock, dealing with a newborn that hated sleep above all else (and she still does, 8 months later). I felt myself a horrible Mother, though I met her every need and loved her I still didn't feel in my heart I wanted children. Then, in one split second, as she turned 8 weeks old, I had an epiphany and it was born on the corners of her first smile. 
Everything I had ever felt about children or their parents before had disappeared, melted as her happy eyes lit up suddenly at the mere sight of me. I cried. I wept for I had never seen something so beautiful in the entirety of my existence. I still can't think of a sight that could match it. 
Now I understand why those sleepless nights are worth it, why totting around countless bags of accessories for your children is worth it, why giving up whatever life you had before your children is all worth it. Just one smile changed my world forever and I will never look back. Since then her laughter, smiles and seeing her grow has given me the greatest gift of all - a life to protect, to love and to comfort.

"They had been told to eat the broccoli first, which they did... Then they proceed to both ask for more broccoli without touching the pizza yet.  I felt like I was in an alternate universe!",6
"This has been happening for almost 2 weeks, and in that time he's gotten 5 new teeth, 3 of them molars. I've been assuming it's just a teething thing and he'll be back to normal soon, but I'm starting to get worried about him not eating enough. He is still breastfeeding very frequently.

My son will put a piece of food in his mouth, or a spoonful of food, and then immediately stick his tongue out so the food falls out of his mouth. I thought he was deliberately spitting out food, because sometimes he's able to eat just fine, but I realized today that he's really not trying to spit out food. I gave him some salmon, one of his favorite foods, and watched him pick it up off the tray, put it in his mouth, and stick his tongue out so that it fell out. Then he picked it up and tried again, and again, getting increasingly frustrated. Sometimes while he's eating now he puts food in his mouth then holds his fingers in his mouth for maybe 10 seconds, like he's trying to hold the food in. 
Is this a common issue with teething? Any ideas on how to help him eat more? Could this be something entirely unrelated to teething that just coincidentally happened while he was getting a bunch of teeth?",6
"This is a long 3 part question. Sorry in advance if it gets rambling-like. 
For the record, my son is 4 months, 18.5 pounds (that's the 95th percentile!) takes 4-5 7 ounce bottles of formula daily, and has GERD. 
My baby boy will be 4 months on Sunday. Over the holidays, we spent time with his grandparents. They gave us a babies r us gift card, which we used to stock up on baby food, bowls, spoons etc. I didn't plan on giving my son food until I checked with his doctor and got the ok around 5 months. But my parents saw the stash of baby food and insisted we try it. I only said ok because  I figured he was too little and wouldn't like it and spit it all out. To my surprise, he loved it. He got the hang of the spoon and swallowing with just two or three bites. He loved the sweet potatoes. So I kept giving it to him. He has tried squash, oatmeal cereal, peas and carrots and loves them all. He leans into the spoon and cries for more. 
First question is how many other moms introduced baby food early? How did it go both short and long term? I obviously will talk to his doctor about it at his check up, but I'm worried she will say stop. He enjoys t so much. He holds his head up well, sits well assisted, understands how to swallow. I think he is ready developmentally even if he isn't old enough"".  Second question  what brand baby food do you use? We got Earths Best Organic First foods at BrU but we don't live near one. It's really important the food be organic and have as few ingredients as possible. And third  because our baby food section at our local stores is so limited",6
"This is a pretty loaded issue and has a lot of controversial topics in it and I'm currently at a cross roads. 
First and foremost I'm a tough dad. I'm stern and I am quick to inform my two sons when I disagree with their actions. That said I'm fair and i'll talk the subject to the ground to explain to them why what they did is wrong and why it's a big deal.
My sons are 8 and 5. My oldest son is doing great this year in third grade. Top 10 kids in his class. Just got his picture taken for being a high level reader. In Kindergarten though he got in trouble every day (Or sad faces if you are familiar with the Face system).
My kids are never mean. (and I like to think I have no delusions of how my kids really are.) They always get in trouble for cutting up. Telling jokes, making other kids laugh. Being a disturbance. I have never gotten any feed back from them being mean to other children.
With my oldest we had a system for every day he misbehaved.
Day One - Lose video games
Day Two - Lose TV
Day Three - Lose little brother
These are in a row. Once he got another day of good behavior (or happy face) the counter would restart. We only made to three days of bad behavior in a row once or twice. 
Over the last couple of years this has worked and he's now to the point where he never gets in trouble. 
This is where my problem begins.
My youngest son started kindergarten this year and has been consistently getting into trouble. Same reasons as the oldest. Cutting up, playing at inappropriate times. Never being mean or anything. Me and my wife assumed we just have to go through the motions again. Using the same system. This time it's not working. My youngest son only plays video games with his brother and TV is whatever. Losing his brother hurts but he gets in trouble so much it's to the point if we continue he will have to be secluded every time he gets home from school. Which I know is no good either and is not healthy.  It was always more of a bluff really, our oldest would have to do some things alone for about an hour and we'd eventually cave and let him go play. Next day the behavior would be back on track. 
My wife has already had two parent teacher conferences and this is only the 2nd month of school.  The first time she kind of danced around that she thinks he needs medicine and this time really pushed that he has Attention issues, and asked if we would sign our corporal punishment form so she can start using that as a means to see if she can get him to behave.
I'm not trying to undermine this teacher at all. She emphasizes that my son is a sweet kid who is kind and treats everyone with respect, and has great manners. So I don't think she is just writing him off but at the same time I feel like she is to the point where she is so frustrated with him that she wants an easy solution to deal with him all year. I'm torn. 
I am in no way going to put my kid on medicine. If I really felt he had an attention or focus problem I would consider it, but me and his brother were told the same things and we both can focus but it's hard to keep up with things that are not particularly interesting. I think that is everyone to some degree but I have learned to pay attention to boring things with age. His brother is getting better and I feel he is just getting started and needs more time. 
My main dilemma is whether or not to go ahead with the corporal punishment form. My wife is strongly against it, and deep down I am too, but I remember as a kid the power of going to the office for a paddling had over me when it came to getting to back to work. 
We are at a crucial crossroads right now. I don't want my son to feel as if school is just something you have to get through and that punishment Is just something you deal with. I want him to understand that what he does has consequences and to think about his actions before he does them. I don't want him to miss this life lesson because of my pride. 
My question: Would you sign the form? And what other things would you do at home to help change adjust this behavior?
EDIT: Thank you all so much for all of your feed back. Me and my wife has been reading all of your comments and we thank you all for feed back and will be using it going forward. We have decided that we will not be signing the corporal punishment form, and that we will be speaking to his doctor to see if he needs to be tested or not and if he is take that to the teacher. Again thank you so much. ",6
"This is going to be long but I have nowhere else to go with this so here you go, reddit!  
My daughter is four and she's always been a picky eater, but lately it's just out of control.  I used to be able to hide veggies in her food and she'd blissfully eat them without realizing it, but now that she's older and can identify foods better she's throwing fits over taking even a single bite of something she doesn't like.
Our rule has always been that she has to take one bite of everything before she can get up. If she refuses to take a single bite for more than twenty minutes then she goes to time out for three minutes, rinse and repeat. She gets nothing to drink or eat but water for two hours prior to a meal, she gets the food I make for us and I always make at least one item I know she will eat without argument... but now if she sees a piece of broccoli on her plate she won't touch anything else on it!   She's really skinny (5th percentile for her height, but she just had a growth spurt and is in the 98th percentile for height) and I know she needed to eat more, but I don't want to be one of those parents that feeds their kid junk just because they're picky as fuck.  (When she was a baby and I went back to work she would refuse to drink from a bottle of pumped milk or formula and would go nine hours between feedings, screaming the whole time.  So clearly she has been stubborn since the get-go.)  
And I'm not some hippy cooking up flax-non-gmo-soy-broccoli-chia burgers or anything like that: I'm a good cook who does average American dinner stuff.  Tonight she and I had a two hour standoff over some rotini pasta with homemade roasted red pepper cream sauce because she saw the specks of basil blended up in it and didn't want to eat that green stuff.""  
Basically  I'd love some creative ideas if anyone has them because I'm clearly not getting anywhere.
Things I've tried:
 just refusing to give her anything else when she won't eat but not actively making her eat (Which resulted in her assuming she didn't have to eat anything for dinner... then 5am the next day she's waking me up begging for food.)  
- Giving her the silent treatment until she eats (50/50 success but I feel like a fucking asshole ignoring her when she's sobbing at the table because she doesn't want to eat a single bite.)
- taking stuff away (more crying  more feeling like an asshole and it never works)
-praising her a shitload when she does eat (still do this but it's hard when she doesn't eat anything except like four foods since I feel like I'm only encouraging her to eat the same things.)
- having her help me make the food.  (This only works with muffins or cupcake-shaped foods  which she will eat anyway.)
- peer pressure (""look your friend likes carrots!"" To which she normally responds by offering her carrots to her friend.)",1

Fat because I gained a lot of weight during pregnancy. - Can't seem to find a swimsuit that isn't super expensive (in case i lose weight and it doesn't fit) that will hide all my stretch marks. 
Ugly because breastfeeding is giving me serious acne.

"This is just me venting and I don't really expect anyone to read it, but I need to get it off my chest anyway.
This whole past week has been a horrific bust.  My brain feels like scrambled eggs.  I have been dealing with a teething, cluster feeding baby and a potty training toddler and I'm loosing my mind.  I wasn't really ready to start potty training but I felt like waiting would have been detrimental since *she* was ready.  And who wants to clean up twice the diapers anyway, right? But it's created this insane complication in my life.  Now I have to try and time everything I do around when she's peed and when the baby's slept and ate.  To make it worse she's still not very consistent with telling me that she needs to go when we're somewhere other than home so I have to ask her constantly.  This has basically forced me into being a hermit since leaving the house with both of them has become a game of Russian Roulette - will she pee herself? Will the baby need to eat while we're out? Is the baby going to take a micro nap in the car and then not take a real nap at the normal time?
Today was the topper on the shit cake too.  I wait until baby is fed and changed and toddler has peed and I risk going out into the real world to go get a new car seat.  I manage to wrangle them together in record time and even with the baby screaming in the back seat because he hates his infant carrier (which is why I'm going to buy a different car seat) I'm feeling good and positive.  We rush in with toddler in cart and baby in sling, grab the box and get to the register to find out my coupon doesn't apply.  Okay, whatever, this is the same car seat I have for my toddler that I bought because she hated the infant carrier too, I'm going to buy it no matter what.
I ask my toddler if she needs to go potty before we leave the store, she confidently says no, so we leave.  I cram our stuff in the car, buckle in the baby and she suddenly needs to go potty.  So I apologize and tell her to try to hold it and we'll be home soon.
Rush all the way home with the baby screaming until he's asleep.  Get my toddler inside the front yard gate and then the baby - I wake him accidentally in the process so he starts screaming again.  Ask toddler if she needs to go potty, and she says No.  I should have known better.  I ask her to go inside and take off her shoes while I lug the baby inside and while my back is turned the cat escapes out the door.  I'm telling the cat to get back in when toddler pees on the floor.  Great.  Just great.
In my frustration I yell at her (Oh god, I know - I KNOW - this is a no no when potty training) and sit her on the potty, get the baby out of the car seat, forget about the cat, have toddler help me clean up pee while explaining how she needs to listen to her body, remember cat, trick cat back inside with the promise of food, all while STILL HOLDING BABY because I woke him from his micro nap and now he's PISSED.  Husband calls and I take my frustrations out on him.  Ugh! It's so hard for me to let go of those little things when they all happen at once and I've still not recovered from the sleep loss I experienced with the baby teething and cluster feeding.  Where is the redo button? I desperately need one.",6

The concept of being a mother is one that I've got down -- change diapers, make bottles, feed appropriate foods, don't give her sharp objects, etc. 

But being mom"" or ""mommy"" is difficult. If I have time with her anything like that. My way of being funny is making puns but she's not talking yet. I know those clap clap games are important for her language development so thankfully my husband knows all of them and is in general good at being silly. When I'm with her alone I spend most of the time running after her trying to keep her from playing with things she shouldn't and stressing out that I'm not getting things done as quickly or as well as I would like because I'm chasing after her (cleaning making dinner  etc).  For example tonight my husband has a work thing I've been with her for about 2 hours and find myself  counting down to bedtime and struggling to find things to do with her. Don't get me wrong. I love my daughter and am so glad we have her. I am affectionate with her -- I loved when she was breastfeeding and would fall asleep on me after eating in the morning but she often squirms out of hugs these days. I don't know I feel like I'm just going through the motions and not really good at this. Maybe I have too much of an achievement-driven personality to be a good ""mommy""? Maybe I'm just bad at the baby-toddler phase? I did a lot of babysitting growing up and really loved teaching kids things. But I can't really teach her anything at this age and so as a somewhat intellectual person I just don't know how to relate to her. Super rambly. Sorry. What's your experience been like as a mom? Did it come naturally or did you have to learn it? If your kids are older did you find the non-verbal years difficult? Edit: forgot to add that I'm already seeing a post-partum therapist and she's assured me this is normal but I don't really believe her since no one seems to admit to this in front of others """,6
"This is meant in no way to be a critique of the feminist cause. In my own view, it furthers it, as it is essentially a humanist cause. 
Having been raised by a feminist mother and attended a all girls school I was all set for parenting my daughter. And then I had my son. And my other son. And my stepsons. And then I realized that I was out of my depth. 
1. In which I learn we females do not have the corner on body image issues: One of my boys was playing one of those fighting game when he announced to me that when he grew up he was going to look like the protagonist. I looked at the 6ft+ behemoth holding a gun it would take a human a forklift to move with his 4ft shoulders and his wasp-hips and said, Kiddo It suddenly clicked that men and boys are at least as bombarded with unrealistic body types as women are - the difference only being that less of their self and societal worth is tied up in physical beauty. Which helped me in parenting my daughter  because then I was able to concentrate on the REAL problem with women's self-esteem which is that idiots think ugly is the worst thing you can be called. And really stupid people think fat means ugly. But if you think on it objectively  both sexes get the same messages from art and advertising. The problem is that one sex has those messages backed up by society at large. Which is immaterial because only an asshole thinks that its enough for a kid to know that they're smart and funny. They have to know that they're attractive too. 2. In which some female soldier from the States gets captured by Iraqis: She was part of some convoy that got ambushed and was taken prisoner. She was one of the first acknowledged female soldiers taken in a combat situation and was eventually freed  along with several male soldiers who'd been with her. And then everybody tripped over themselves wanting to know if she'd been raped. Well fucking duh she was raped. But nobody tripped over themselves to hear all about the rape of the male soldiers. And fucking duh they were raped too. Because rape isn't something that is done because someone sees a   it's a power thing Except the difference is that if my son is raped  which is possible Fellow feminists  this used to be the shit we had to deal with. Cops asking us how much we'd drank
3. Which leads us to the Hollywood slap: Watch some old movies and if a broad gets lippy she gets herself a smack  and nobody thought twice of it. You mouth off But nowadays it's verboten to hit a girl... and yet Sawyer on Lost ate a fist at least three times a season. We get it. He's a shit. An asshole. But seriously  wtf? Do we have so tenuous a hold on our emotions that we have to resort to physical violence? And have you ever taken a slap? It fucking sucks. Even when someone hits you by accident the natural immediate reaction is to punch them in the throat and watch them choke to death. Getting slapped or hit on purpose is like a violation of the social code. And guys are supposed to take it Amazing how much of this is just subtle misogyny nu? And this one really bugged me. I can't imagine someone hitting my boy. I didn't know what to tell them how to guide them for this eventuality. Fine it's a dude And then one day I met this kid in the neighborhood who laughed at me for my fears and said  ""Shit Oh lord. I have not the words. It was perfect. Enough now. I'm tired. If you're interested and I get inspired I'll prattle on uselessly more about the differences between preparing boys and girls for this world 
EDIT: 4. REJECTION. Oh my god. This is another big one for me. Ladies  if someone comes up to you in a bar and hits on you and you're not into it  say ""You need to leave now. Your inability to understand that I am turning down your offer is offputting and creepy. Stop immediately or I will alert everyone in the vicinity that I am starting to feel threatened by you."" Do NOT roll your eyes and say ""As if  loser!"". Do NOT just turn around to your girlfriends and start giggling. Do NOT sneer or mock or shit on people. Half the reason that douche-bags have to wear their douche-bag armor is because dumb bitches keep flinging douches at them. So knock it off. Parents I for one am teaching my boys to just sadly shake their heads and tell rude girls  ""Years from now",6
"This is mostly me complaining, but also looking for any advice to make life easier. I have a 2 year old and a 1 month old. I have to get up early to HOPEFULLY get a shower in before the little one wakes up and demands to eat. It's not too big of a deal unless we have to be somewhere earlyish.†Eating for the baby is a game. I am breastfeeding and pumping (because I want some saved so I can be away for a few hours if needed). However, he decides half the time that he doesn't want the boob. There's no specific part of the day..sometimes it's morning, sometimes night. So, that makes feeding time a lot longer than it should be. Pumping in itself takes up plenty of time, but I'm thinking of cutting it down to only a couple times of day. It's hard, though, because I never know how much he's going to take from me, and how much from the bottle. I don't want my supply to completely diminish. Then, especially in the morning, the baby wants to be held, but the toddler wants breakfast and cuddle time since it was just me and him every day (until daddy got home from work) for two years. They both end up crying, because I'm trying to juggle both. Any advice? I might try baby in a front carrier sometimes to see if that satisfies his need for me to hold him. But, I'm stressing!!",6
"This is my second son and the second time I have had this problem and I have yet to find a solution. Obviously he is breastfed as was my first and I never needed to introduce a bottle as I'm in pain too if I miss a feeding so now I want to go away overnight with my husband and I can't get him to take a bottle! I know I should have started introducing a bottle earlier but was always scared I would create an issue with breastfeeding. I've tried multiple cups and bottles and have tried filling them with fresh and frozen breast milk and powder and liquid formula and a combination of the two with no success. I've had my husband and my mom try to feed him a bottle as well and they had no more success than I. To complicate the issue he hates all food too so there is no way to feed him without me. He cries, clamps his mouth, spits it out, etc when I try and feed him anything. I've tried cereals, beginner fruits and vegetables with no luck. If I try and force him to eat he throws it all up. I talked to my doctor and he suggested going slow and going back to really thin cereal which I tried and he was no happier and it is very difficult to even get a bite in if it's too thin. We are supposed to go in less than a week and I have had no success, suggestions?!?!",6
"This is my third, and the problem is when he eats, he keeps putting more and more in his mouth until he chokes. It's scary for everyone. So I am still feeding him stage 3 baby food. He can eat that on his own, but I cannot even feed him steamed peas or bits of cheese. No matter how small I cut it up he will still choke. 
18318,
18319,For now I feed him his breakfast, let him feed himself his lunch, feed him his dinner before we eat, then when we eat I feed him a snack of some sort (cheerios, cheese, gerber puffs, etc.) but I can only put 2 of whatever on his tray at a time. Is there anyway I can get him to stop choking himself? ",2
"This is probably wasted here (you are conscientious enough to read the parenting sub-reddit), but here goes: 
I returned yesterday from chaperoning a 3-day field trip with my daughters 5th grade class to a barrier island camp, and have this observation:  While I understand you kid wants you to pack some great snacks for his/her field trip, the amount of candy and junk food these kids brought was ridiculous - and then they had money to spend at the camp canteen, and bought even more candy.
Seriously, the few behavior and health issues we had to work with were (IMO) directly related to kids on sugar and/or caffeine binges coming crashing back to earth.  One kid clutching is stomach 30 minutes after arrive - come to find out he's shot-gunned 2 Mountain Dew Kick-Starters or some such.  The worst behavior we had was from a little boy who probably ate a TON of candy, and by the last evening, he had just crashed and burned in a spectacular break-down tantrum.
I had packed a lot of extra snacks, expecting a few of the kids might not bring anything with them, but even though a kid might have only brought one change of clothes instead of the 4-5 needed (walking in a salt marsh is messy!) - they had insane amounts of chocolate bars.
Long story short - you aren't doing your kid any favors with all that candy on field trips, if anything you are setting them up for failure - they will already be naturally excited, and all that junkfood just throws gasoline on the fire.  Your kid will do better and the volunteer chaperones will appreciate it if you keep the junk food at home.  Your child will NOT exhibit self-control to only eat a little each day.

"This is something I have been thinking about recently and after reading another post on here today I thought I'd ask to get some ideas! I know there are quite a few people on here that have kids in a mixed culture. My hubby is Filipino and I am *very* white and pretty american as they get (sans my political and religious beliefs). We live very far away from my husband's family and only get to see them once or twice a year. We want nothing more than for our daughter (and future children) to be familiar with their Filipino heritage. Being the non-Filipino one in the relationship, how can I help this? I feel like every time I try to learn something, my husband almost doesn't care. He even criticizes my culture at times or tells me that I can't understand"" his because we were raised in two totally different worlds. She's only 2 months old so we definitely have time to figure it out. What do you moms do to help your children know their culture? Aside from the obvious send to Lola for a few weeks a year. :) So far the only thing I can do is eat my weight in Filipino food. """,6
"This is what our day is like:
- Up at 8am-ish
- Breakfast, then snack 2 hours later
- Nap around noon-ish.  I change his diaper, (sometimes) brush his teeth, and rock/sing until he's out. Transfer to crib.
- 2 hours later, he wakes up, usually crying like mad.
- Lunch, then I go to work at 4 and husband comes home.
- I come home at 8pm; sometimes he's just finished dinner, sometimes I feed it to him.
- (Sometimes) last sippy of milk around 9:30-10pm.
- 10:15: Change into nighttime diaper and pajamas, brush teeth.
- Rock/sing until he's out.  Transfer to crib.  Usually by 10:30.
 About once or twice a week on average, he will wake up around 3-4am.  Most nights, it's only a shout or two and he goes back to sleep, but sometimes he's standing up in his crib and crying hard, so I or my husband will pick him up, go back into the living room, and rock him.  I can usually get him back to sleep and put him back in his crib.  My husband has trouble with the crib-transfer and sometimes just sleeps with him on the couch.  I had to couch it with him last night because he would wake up every time I stood up from the rocker.
SOMETIMES, when he wakes up during the crib-transfer, I can still get him to sleep if I do the old shush-hand-on-back thing, and lay him back down once or twice when he stands, crying, to be picked up.  Not always, though.
He has no night-light in his room.  We listen to a soft rainstorm-loop in the living room with the lights off/blinds drawn for nap/bedtime rocking, but there's no noise machines in his room.  We have [this soother](http://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-Precious-Planet-Melodies-Soother/dp/B0021L8S82/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1350497195&sr=8-1&keywords=precious+planet+soother) attached to his crib, but if I turn it on, he stands up to press the buttons and stare at it; it has never seemed to soothe him and instead only stimulates him and keeps him up, whether I have it set to lights or just music.
I just need a course of action, I guess, and to be able to lay it out for my husband so that we can both follow through on it.  At his last check-up, the pediatrician (I am cycling through the 8 doctors at this practice; so far, they've all been unsatisfying in some way.  This was a new one to us) said that I could leave him to cry it out for up to an hour, which blew my mind.  It goes against my grain to let our son stress himself out for that long, but as time goes on and it gets harder to put him to bed (I fear the day when we have to switch it to a toddler bed and he can get out at will), it's been tempting to see if it would work.
As far as our son goes, he is still just cruising and has three words down pat: Mommy, Daddy, and Bubbles.  He's working on Duck, Cookie, and Milk.  Not very useful communication at bedtime.  I know he understands SOME of what we say, because I will quiz him on a puzzle (where's the hippo?) and he'll grab the right piece about 75% of the time, or ask him to shut a door and he'll do it, or ask him where my belly button is and he'll lift up my shirt and poke it, for example. I still have to divert unwanted behavior because I don't think he understands punishments yet.  He is an only child and doesn't get to see other people/kids much (see username; another problem), so he is not very engaging with people, although I play and talk to him as much as I can during the day. We don't have pets and, aside from music in the background, our house is pretty quiet.
I just... It's not a HORRIBLE schedule, because we don't always have to struggle to get him to sleep/stay asleep, but I just feel like I'm doing something wrong.  I also see a lot of people talking about how their kid goes to bed at 8:00 and sleeps for 12 hours, AND has a nap during the day, and I'm starting to wonder if he's just not getting enough sleep.  He gets 12 hours with bedtime (~10) and nap (~2).  He used to sneak in another hour nap while my husband was on watch, but he grew out of that half a year ago (to Daddy's deep chagrin) and never altered the remains of his schedule.
I'm sorry I'm rambling, but it's really bothering me.  I know all babies are different, but is this beyond the norm?  Is it too late to fix it somehow?  I am thinking about just throwing my old iPod in his room on a soft rainstorm loop to see if that helps, but beyond that, I have no idea what to do.  I could really use some advice.",6
"This isn't really a recipe but yesterday I took about a cup, cup and a half of flavored rice and a handful of peas, and gently mixed it with a beaten egg. I put it at the bottom of a greased cupcake pan at 400¬∞f for about 15 min, give or take. It made about five little patties that I could cut into cubes that were still crumbly but easier to pick up than loose rice. It was a hit! I froze a few and hopefully they keep well.",4

My boyfriend of 2 years, we'll call him Jerry, and I had a very unexpected child at age 19 (we are both 22 now). We were both using heroin during our entire relationship and this was a big change in mainly my lifestyle. I stopped using, got a full time job and really focused on being healthy.
When I told Jerry I was pregnant he broke up with me but then tried to rekindle everything once I started showing a lot. I refused to get back with him until my son, let's call him Jacob, was about 2 months old and we were living in our first apartment. Jerry got a job and stayed around for a few months but then broke up with me over the phone saying, this just isn't the life I wanted"" and he took off to Austin to resume his train hopping
Jerry's mother let's call her Darla The bruises were clearly not from me the hand prints were way too big I did everything I could to get him back I took parenting classes I have refused to let him go back to Darla's without me because CPS told me that I am the primary care giver and if anything goes wrong anywhere I will be held responsible. Since then I payed for Darla and I to go to counseling because I really didn't want to cut my son's family out of his life. She just said what I wanted to hear and didn't change any of her behavior or follow through with anything we talked about in counseling. Jerry was still train hopping or whatever and NEVER around so I just stopped all contact with Darla. This week however Jerry called me and sent me several texts saying he wants to get his act together and be in Jacob's life. I agreed to go to the museum with him this weekend but I don't know if I'm making the right choice. I don't want to deny my son his father but I don't want Jerry to do the right thing for a few months and then bail to use and be a punk. What do you guys think? Do I let Jerry around Jacob again? Any advice will help. My son hasn't asked about him at all since I got him back because he rarely saw him to begin with. I feel weird being like ""Oh Jacob let's go see your daddy."" I kind of want to let them meet and just see how my son reacts to him. I don't know what the best approach to take is.
TL;DR I had a child at a young age with a junkie who has never gotten his act together and he wants to come around again. Do I let him?""",6

It seems over the years that dehydration has become a big worry for parents, at least where I live.  I thought i had read that the original 'adults need 48 oz of water a day' was from a researcher in the 1950s that found out that is how much water an adult human needs each day... but didn't take into account that food has water in it, so you don't actually have to *drink* 48 oz a day.  
I just read on livestrong.com that adults should drink 48-64oz a day.  Is there any evidence for this assertion?
Anyway, my son just started playing soccer at his school.  he just spent an entire summer at a daycare with a dozen other kids, playing outside all day long in the summer heat.  I highly doubt they drank water each hour, but when i failed to bring my son's water bottle to his soccer practice, i was basically scolded for it.  I should bring it in case he is thirsty of course, but it seemed that forgetting it was a huge issue.  They seem to feel that 20 minutes of running around in 78 degree heat requires re-hydration.  Isn't this going a bit overboard?
I just wonder if this trend is like the anti-fat dieting of the 1980s and 1990s.  For years and years we were told fat was evil and would destroy our bodies, and today the nutrition world seems tohave a tough time admitting they were wrong.  If you're thirsty, get a drink.  If you aren't, why force yourself?",6
"This time, two years ago, I was in hell.  

I had found out I was pregnant shortly after finishing college. Until that moment, life was all about trips to the beach, lazy Sundays with friends, rushing off to work, class, the gym, long weekends with my boyfriend. But out of nowhere - contraception failure - I was pregnant. I had no time to adjust to a new life or new goals. It just happened at the wrong time. My boyfriend and I were terrified. Our relationship was strong, he had a good job and I had good job prospects, so we went for it. But man, I cried nearly every night. I felt like my personhood was gone, my independence, my freedom, my opportunities and above all, my identity - all gone. Dramatic, but that's how I felt.     

When our son was born, I was in a haze. That moment of instantly falling in love"" never came and I was so angry that anyone had ever told me to expect it. I struggled through baby blues but didn't start to feel better as the weeks went on. I felt useless he was a stranger in my house and I went through the motions keeping him clean  fed When our son was three weeks old my boyfriend was made redundant. We went from a 6-figure salary to nothing. We moved to the city in the hope of finding work. Our financial security was gone I was struggling to breastfeed  so I used a pump. As we moved house that my supply completely disappeared. I felt like a failure.    Months went by and my relationship with my son improved hugely. I felt genuine joy at his successes felt genuine sadness when he cried. I was head-over-heels in love eat up in his high chair. It was a relief. But I wasn't myself  my days felt pointless  I felt heavy with the burden of caring for him. I would break down almost every day My point in all this is that it got better.     My boyfriend found a new job so we're making ends meet. When my son turned 18 months he started at the local daycare so I could start graduate school. That changed everything for me. He is still my reason for getting out of bed in the morning and the last thing I think about before I fall asleep. But I also have a thing every day that is mine. I have colleagues that what he needed from me was genuine happiness and fulfillment.      My son is 2 now. He can't wait to get into daycare every morning but jumps up and down laughing when he sees me every afternoon. He never stops talking is happy  we joke around  figure things out  count things I want to say this for anyone at home with a sleeping 4 month old  a teething 8 month old  but do what you know in your heart is right for you because that way everyone wins. Things get better  life changes fast your babies change fast. Infants are terribly boring to some (me) This is not to say my choice is right for everyone. And it's not to say that putting a toddler into daycare is right for all families financially  to know that things get better if you take control you will become 'you' again  but an even better version.

"This turned out to be kind of long....and a little vent-y. 
Let me set this up:
He was born at 41 weeks and 3 days weighing 11lbs and 13oz and he was 22 inches. Before leaving the hospital to go home he weighed 10lbs 10oz. At 12 days old he weighed 12 lbs. 
I feed him expressed breast milk. 
I have supplemented him a few days with formula but it constipates him so I've been avoiding doing that now.
Between 1-2 weeks old he was already eating 4oz. every 3-4 hours. His pediatrician told me not to worry about it as long as he isn't spitting up - which he very rarely does. 
This week, even after eating 4oz has started making hunger-cues. (crying, shoving his hands in his mouth, make sucking motions and lick his lips..)
SO now all of the sudden he is eating up to 8oz. every 3-5 hours or around 2oz every hour or so. Yesterday, it seemed like he wouldn't stop eating. If he wasn't eating he was crying about not eating. Maybe he is going through a growth spurt?
Lately, my (damn) MIL began hinting that she thinks I am over-feeding him... saying things like well Honestly  I am a FTM but if she hadn't said such things to me then I probably wouldn't be doubting myself so much. She acts like poking a bottle in his mouth is always my first response to crying. It's not. I have spent many hours listening to him cry while I tried to distract him with rocking singing but I will admit that I am a bit confused because I know this is not average. How Should I measure how much he should be eating? by his age? his weight? how much he wants so long as he isn't spitting up? I'm not sure what I am looking for - anecdotes? recommendations? reassurance? MIL bashing? Anyone else have an unusually large newborn/baby?
Am I setting him up to be like one of those fat kids on Maury? Is he already destined to be like those fat kids on Maury?  (I sure hope not.)
TL;DR: 
Born: 31weeks and 3 days weighing 11lbs 13 oz / 22 inches - eating 2 oz every 3-4 hours
2 weeks:  12lbs - eating 4oz every 3-4 hours
4 weeks: 12+lbs eating 5-8oz every 3-4 hours or approx. 2 oz every hour awake
Has anyone experienced anything like this? Does this seem like too much for a baby this size/age? How should you determine how much a baby should eat? *I am going to call his pediatrician tomorrow but for now I can't sleep and am curious/insecure. 
and finally here are a couple of pictures of my big boyÖ

"Throwawaaaaaaaaay... Our son is 12 months old, healthy and happy as can be. Mom, however, is 5'7 and hasn't been able to crack the 105lb boundary for the entire year.

There are no eating disorders in the picture--mom is a grazer who prefers foods on the lighter side. We both eat the same meals, usually pasta, pizza, Mexican, sandwiches, etc. We're poor, so we eat meat maybe 1 or 2 meals a week, but there's always lots of cheese, peas, spinach, lentils, nuts, etc. so it's not like we don't get protein.

I am always very encouraging; I tell her she's beautiful every day. She'll tell me whether she's dropped or gained a pound (usually in a frustrated tone), and I just say it'll get better and to keep trying. Has anyone else here struggled with weight gain after birth?",6
"Throwaway here...
**TL;DR I'm pregnant with my second child, both parents have serious health problems such that we really aren't sure if we can handle a second one. We're considering abortion, but are hoping for outside perspective**
I have a beautiful son, 11 months old, and I just found out I'm pregnant again. We were trying not to have a second one, but we were afraid of SIDS stealing our hope of a family, so we wanted to get fixed when he was a year old.
Thing is, his father and I both have serious health issues. He has Crohn's disease (a bad bowel disease that gets worse with stress) and I have Ehler Danlos syndrome, which is a genetic problem that, among other things, seriously screws up my joints.
We wanted a family, so I didn't care how bad it would be. I knew it would be hard, and it was. The last 4 months of my pregnancy, I was helpless - my joints were too unstable to do anything. I had a mini fridge by the bed stocked with fruit and salad, and it was the utmost limit of my ability to get to the bathroom. When he was born, I needed a C-section, because natural birth can end very badly with my condition, and I was seriously handicapped from the C-section as well.
So, if we had a second child, it would be all on my husband... who bleeds profusely when stressed, and while he's managed to avoid hospitalization so far, if he had to essentially be a single dad for 2 kids all of a sudden... neither of us are sure he can handle it.
And we don't have enough money to afford a helping hand, nor do we have family anywhere nearby.
I honestly... I don't know how we could handle it. How we could manage a second child.
If it were just my husband and I that would suffer, I think I'd endure it. But... who's going to be there for my son? Am I just going to essentially abandon him, too trapped in medical problems to be the mom he needs? If I have a second child, how much will he have to sacrifice?
That's the part that kills me, that I can't emotionally accept. I want him to have a family he deserves, not a mom so handicapped that he can't be picked up, and a dad so stressed he's constantly in the hospital... and we're afraid if things get too bad, health wise, we'll end up unable to hold our jobs, and then losing our house. And then where will our son be?
So we're considering abortion, and it's breaking my heart. I am pro-choice, but I'm generally only pro-choice in dire circumstances. My life and my son's life aren't at risk. We could, theoretically, do better than we think, and things might be okay... but then, they might really not.
I don't know what to think. My husband feels the same way I do - torn and uncertain.
I hoped that maybe you guys can give me some outside perspective, maybe help me sort through this mess.
Thank you for reading this.
Edit: Thank you everyone for your responses. By and large, you've been kind and supportive, and have helped me sort through the wild emotions of this news.
We've concluded that we do, definitely, want to keep her... and that we definitely don't have the resources to do so. Unless I find some sort of assistance that I don't presently know about, it seems abortion is our only option. 
I shudder to think of our situation if abortion were illegal... this is terrifying enough as is.
Thank you again.",6

"tl:dr (at the top!) We have a 7.5 month old who did, but now won't eat solids.
Our 7.5 month old has been fantastic except that he is refusing to eat solids. His development is great, he is normally sized and crawls, climbs and stands. It is just the feedings where he is driving us a little crazy.
We started him on solids at 4 months with rice and oat cereal and he was doing fine. He made it all the way up to 3 tablespoons per meal after a month. We introduced all kinds of other pureed foods and he was skeptical but eventually got into them. His favorite were sweet potato and apple, but he was always a little resistant. Some he likes more then others so we would favor those but still adding in the less favored to build his palette. 
We kept slowly introducing new foods and moved into small chunks as he became interested in self feeding. Over the last month, every meal has been a struggle. It started with him being shut mouthed to now we can get a few bites and everything becomes becomes crying fussing. It has gotten to the point that even his favorite foods create a fit. 
Mom and I always play it cool and keep things fun for him. But this is getting ridiculous.

"Tl;dr. 13 mo. is healthy and happy but drops everything now to watch tv. I let her because I need down time... Or im lazy. Ok so I will start off by saying that I have always had the tv on in the background. I just find it comforting. When my baby was born I binge watched netflix while nursing and I just continued to leave the tv on in the back ground whenever we are at home. My daughter is 13 months now. For the longest time she mostly ignored the tv. She would play, eat facing away from it and so on. Recently though she has gotten fascinated with it (and certain shows or movies) and its making me feel like I made a huge mistake. She always ignored the tv so it felt harmless, but now when it is on she won't eat, play or anything. She just sits and stares. I know it isn't healthy but I am tempted (and have often) let her watch tv like that for an hour while I did all my dishes, sweeping etc. I read an article today saying it damages kids by not allowing them the focus to explore their surroundings or use their imagination. It can also apparently limit speech progress and result in emotional problems? I dunno. I have suffered from moderate/severe anxiety, mild depression and chronic fatigue (which turned out to be undiagnosed ADD) for years. I think I am allowing myself to let her sit in front of the tv because I am the type of person that needs alone time or down time. Maybe I am lazy. I don't know. To give some context to this problem, she seems fine. She eats a varied healthy diet, is almost never sick. Loves exploring the living room, hallway and her bedroom which are all babyproofed. She naps once a day for 3 hours (usually this is when I do the bulk of the cleaning) and sleeps 12 hours at night. Shes about as happy as a toddler gets but I want what is best for her. Any suggestions? Is tv really that bad? I am a post grad university student with evening classes and I work every weekend and holiday as a cleaner at a hospital. I get a bit of a break on the evenings and weekends when my husband takes care of my daughter but messes dont bother him so I clean pretty much everything and make dinners too. :( help.",6

"To set the stage...
So my nephew comes from a broken home. His mother is extremely lax with discipline and his dad is very mean, I would say abusive and at the very least, neglectful which is why the parents split in the first place.
His mom is my husband's sister so there is no direct relation to me (just to get that out of the way) and so whenever we see the kids (she has a daughter also) they are with their mom.
I worry about my nephew. When my oldest was younger, he would attempt to harm my daughter in different ways. Mostly pushed and a general disregard for her. He really did not care she existed. When his sister came along, it was the same sort of thing. Now that the kids are a little older, they fight a lot and constantly get in trouble for hitting and pushing each other.
I now have a 19 month old son and he wants to play with the older kids. My daughter does really well with him. She's a little motherly at times but mostly they act like normal siblings. 
I'm terrified of my nephew being around my son. Recently, the kids came over to our house to have dinner (I sometimes cook for the whole family) and we let them play outside. I was watching them but I went inside for no more than 1 maybe 2 minutes to grab my drink that was sitting on the table. I walked back outside just in time to see my nephew shoving my son face first down the slide. I, of course, got mad and sent the kids back inside and checked my son for injuries.
I told my sister-in-law what had happened and she did nothing. She cottled her son as he explained to her while he cried, that my son was taking too long and that he was in his way and that it was all my son's fault for making him push him. I was livid and I still am.
He never gets disciplined for the things he does to my kids. If he is disciplined, it me or my husband doing it. It is never her. She doesn't discipline him and when she tries, she never follows through. 
I know that she was abused by her ex-husband and I know that her kids are currently abused and neglected by him also but she refuses to do anything about it and won't bring up any evidence in court against him. So she does what she always has done about things like this, she's passive. Extremely passive.
I don't know what to do about it. I really don't. Bringing it up with my husband, just makes him mad because it's his sister and her kids. He feels like he does what he can and leaves it at that. 
I also do what I can to help out by doing things like making dinner for the whole family, giving my mother-in-law breaks from taking care of everyone (she takes care of my niece and nephew A LOT).
My sister-in-law, does nothing. She goes out and parties whenever she doesn't have the kids, she's forgetful when it comes to family events and she's flakey about helping out.
My nephew exhibits signs of having Oppositional Defiance Disorder and ADHD and my sister in law refuses to take him to counseling/doctor due to money, even though I explained to her that she can get State Aid - Healthy Families due to her income and the size of her family.
I feel terrible for these kids but I don't know what to do. Should I call CPS? If I do, what will happen? The kids stay 60% with their dad, now at their other grandparents' house and their household is stable but they are all emotionally abusive to one another. Their dad used to complain about the abuse he endured there and now the kids are living in it.

"Today we started daycare and I'm already regretting it. My partner and I followed the enrollment packet suggestions for clothes, diapers, and food but the infant teacher said that what we provided was not enough. She asked for 3 full days of clothes and diapers, which is fine, but I think I will need to buy some more tonight. We use cloth diapers so I might even buy some extras. What has me fretting is food. I sent along two bottles dry soy formula, three smallish bags of breast milk and a packet of strawberry banana purae. My milk supply has been very low even though I am guzzling Mothers Milk tea and stuffing my face with cookies and energy bites made of flax seed and Brewers Yeast. My baby drank all the breast milk before noon and the teacher said they only give mixed formula - or in other words, I can't send dry formula and ask them to add water and shake. I have to mix it. But the formula we use says on package it is only good for one hour after mixed. My commute to work and daycare is an hour exactly so I can't bring formula without risking it going bad. I just don't know what to do! The process of dropping baby off and getting her settled eliminates the morning time I had for pumping and I don't have time on my lunch break to feed her when I visit and then pump. I'm already worried that when I pump in the evening I will be sitting there for hours and get little dribbles, which is apparently my new normal. How can I get my supply back up to the 200 ml range instead of the pitiful 90 ml I pump now? EDIT: Thank you all very much for your insights - I appreciate you taking the time. I took the day off of work to try to get ahead on pumping. I talked to a lactation consultant and a doula. There's a lot of good advice here for keeping formula so thank you very much!†",6

"Tonight, I wasn't sure whether to give my baby his usual 2 tablespoons of baby cereal for dinner. I felt discouraged because I knew he would wake up every hour or two anyway (with breastfeeding the easiest way for all of us to get back to sleep). I'm now deciding to be more proactive about helping my baby develop good sleeping habits. 
First though, I'd like to get his daytime eating and sleeping routine in good shape. For those of you with babies around this age who sleep through the night, how many meals do they eat during the day, what qualities and at what times? What time do you put your baby to bed at night? 
My son is average height but has gorgeous soft rolls on his arms and legs. It's clear he's not starving. He eats a light breakfast of yogurt, 5 oz of veg/meat/carbs for lunch, a banana and an apple at 3pm. I worry that he doesn't eat enough during the day so have asked daycare to give him a bottle of formula. They try at 5pm but it's a bit hit or miss. (He doesn't want the bottle at other times.) I breastfeed him around 6:30pm but don't really know what to do about his dinner time. I've heard that babies just need milk at night so don't always push him to eat. He usually just samples a bit of what we eat or has some bread or baby cereal. Then I nurse him to sleep around 8:45. He wakes for milk basically through the night. 
Back when he was 5 months, he spontaneously starting doing his nights from one week to the next. It lasted for about 2 months and it's been lots of night time wake ups ever since. He had a week of sleeping a bit better at one point and I could see that he ate much more during the day as a result. If anyone has any tips, I'd much appreciate it! ",6

"Two years ago I received custody of my [completely awesome] kids after their mother, *Jane*, [basically] abandoned them at her mother's, *Claire*, to leave the state for a vacation"" of an undetermined amount of time. Claire ended up receiving custody of all four children. (Two other siblings were from her second husband.) The kids remained in her care for the remainder of the school year until it was decided that I would receive custody of my two children and they would live with me in *Arkansas*. The current parenting plan explains that they should spend eight weeks with their mother but requires visitation to be supervised by Claire. I was leery at first with the arrangement of Claire supervising; I wasn't sure if I could trust her with actually supervising or just dropping the kids off with their mother and leaving  all the while flying under the radar. I wish I would have done something about it then After one summer  it was obvious to me she never intended to supervise visitation at all. She only wanted to be in the middle of things to keep herself involved Once they were home  it was clear they had been left to their own devices the whole time. They had not been required to bathe Things have changed since last summer. Claire is no longer married and living in an apartment with the two younger siblings. She maintains the facade of supervising visitation to me but is quite candid about the actual plans on where the kids will stay when talking to them - they will stay with Jane. Jane is squatting while her friend is out of town. Under the assumption that she will actually supervise visitation; Claire does not have room for them. They will definitely not have their own rooms  but hopefully their own beds **if** I put them on the plane. Since they're significantly older than their younger siblings The parenting plan still requires her to supervise visitation with Jane.
Here's my dilemma:
 * Sending my kids is not an option for me
 * I don't have the money or I would already be in court
 * I think it would be very easy to hold me in contempt if I don't send them
 * I have no reason to believe Claire will supervise
 * I have no reason to believe Jane (recently fired) will be a real parent
 * My wife and I have planned their summer camps since earlier this year
 * I've talked to my kids about it and they seem good with staying here for the summer
 * Jane nor Claire can give a civil reply to my concerns about the environment there
Has anyone else been in this position? Right now  I'm happy to say my kids will stay here but it will mean consequences down the road. I'm not entirely sure what that might be. If anyone can tell me I don't sound like a control freak and my concerns are genuine  hearing that would really help. I'm using a throwaway just in case. I may reply to comments in a message as opposed to in the thread. Any peace of mind is welcome; objectivity as well.""",6
"Up until he was 5 and a half months old he was breastfed with occasional bottle feeding. Then he started weaning with one meal of purees, such as sweet potato, carrot, banana, baby rice. Now this week he has started having 2 purees and 3 bottles of formula milk per day.

My baby girl is 3 months old today, and about a week ago she started having bad gas/stomach pains (mostly) at night. This lasts anywhere from 30min to 2hrs when it happens. She's had gas pains before, but it's never been consistent like this. I can hear her tummy gurgling too. I've gone to a strict rolled oats, rice, and chicken diet to make sure it's not something I'm eating. It has been a couple days on my new diet now, and I was hoping to see improvement, but last night she had one of her longer episodes. I guess I'm wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar? Was it just a phase? Was it a diet issue or was there something you did that helped? We use gripe water sometimes, or when it's bad, gas drops. Is it possible that she's becoming colicy this late? I've read that normally colic *clears* by the 3rd or 4th month, not starts... It just breaks my heart to have her be in pain - any insight/ advice would be nice. Thank you!",6
"update**yes, we have had success! we've been burping her more actively, doing daily tummy massage, and giving her the colic soothe probiotics and we've now been three nights without any gas/ tummy episodes at all! and luckily it doesn't seem to have anything to do with my diet! I'm slowly starting to eat normal food again and we're still doing good :D ( which is good because plain rice and chicken was getting kinda old! the things you do for your kid right? lol ) and shes been pooping everyday now for the past 4 days as well! ( she was only going every other day previously ) I'm so happy my baby girl isn't in pain any more, i cant thank all of you enough! that being said were pretty sure she's starting to teeth, from one problem on to the next! lol but again, I wanna thank all of you for all your awesome advice, it truly helped my baby girl, which is absolutely priceless!!! My baby girl is 3 months old today, and about a week ago she started having bad gas/stomach pains (mostly) at night. This lasts anywhere from 30min to 2hrs when it happens. She's had gas pains before, but it's never been consistent like this. I can hear her tummy gurgling too. I've gone to a strict rolled oats, rice, and chicken diet to make sure it's not something I'm eating. It has been a couple days on my new diet now, and I was hoping to see improvement, but last night she had one of her longer episodes. I guess I'm wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar? Was it just a phase? Was it a diet issue or was there something you did that helped? We use gripe water sometimes, or when it's bad, gas drops. Is it possible that she's becoming colicy this late? I've read that normally colic *clears* by the 3rd or 4th month, not starts... It just breaks my heart to have her be in pain - any insight/ advice would be nice. Thank you!",6
"UPDATE: We are nearly positive the problem is sleep apnea.  He is overweight.  He has a family history.  His breathing patterns at night are consistent with those of obstructive sleep apnea.  Thank you Reddit for your collective knowledge! 

I went out to ask him about the apnea, and he had passed out on the couch with a full, cold glass of beer next to him, glasses on, and remote in hand.  I had to physically shake him to rouse him.  We both think this is the possible problem and he's going to pursue weight loss as a course of action until we can schedule a sleep study. 

PS-- the people who thought I was super-overreacting by being desperate for a solution to this problem can take a chill pill themselves.  I'm by no means a perfectionist, nor am I uptight about... anything.  My kid eats, sleeps, and gets held or played with whatever feels right for all of us at the time.  I don't expect perfection out of my husband, either, which is why I forgave (but did not forget!) the first time this happened.  Of course I trust him.  I prefaced the whole post with wonderful relationship.""  I believe everything he says.  We just had a very real problem that needed a solution My husband and I have a wonderful relationship.  We have a happy healthy 5 1/2 month old son. At the beginning of July  when our son was ~2.5 months old as he sometimes did and was in another room with baby.  I tried to call again three times-- thinking certainly he would be getting worried-- but to no avail.  I got home around 11:30 to find a raccoon on my front doorstep.  Fuck if I was going to mess with him!  Went around to the porch to come in the side door.  As soon as I stepped into the porch  I knew something was wrong.  The light was on in the office I'm thinking the worst.  My husband has had a seizure.  Maybe he's dead.  Maybe he completely lost it and left the house.  Maybe he's drunk off his ass and passed out.  Someone's broken in and tied him up and stolen all of our stuff.  I didn't know what to think  but Momma Bear had kicked in at that point I bust in the house  and the bedroom is about 10 feet from the door.  My husband is laying on the bed.  I scream his name from the doorway and run to his side.  He wakes up.  He was **sound the fuck asleep.** Curled up in bed OUR SON IS SCREAMING.""  I came within an inch of throwing the rusty old axe at him.  He wakes up in a daze wondering what I'm so worked up about.  He finally (after ~5 seconds) gets the message that our son is screaming at the other end of the house.  He goes to get him still in a daze.  I'm thinking at this point that surely he's drunk.  Why else would he leave our son unattended like that?  Realize my mistake and go take the baby from him as soon as he's picked him up.  I'm still flipping out.  Realize the baby is still freaking out He apologized and blamed the long work day  and taking care of a baby for 4 hours after that.  He blamed his cell phone for not ringing.  I get on him about making excuses I'm not sure what happened after that.  The adrenaline faded.  I do remember telling my husband  ""This will never happen again."" Fast forward to tonight.  I worked all day and brought home another infant who belongs to some friends of mine who wanted to attend an outdoor festival.   We have a great time with my 12-year-old brother and the two babies.  Little girl's mom and my mom come to pick up their respective kids.  Husband's had a fair amount of video game time that evening so I request that I can eat a snack and play some video games.  He's tired.  Fair enough!  Offers to take the baby into the bedroom and watch youtube together so I can play.  Sounds like an awesome idea.  Brings baby out after a little while so I can feed him his before-bedtime solid food.  Take a clean who's still watching Youtube in the bedroom.  Hand him over and get back to my video game.  About half an hour later I see a funny Reddit post and send it to my husband's phone.  Don't hear back in ~30 seconds so I go back to tell him about it.  I get about halfway there before I hear that sound again-- the **I AM IN PAIN AND ANGUISH** scream that makes a mother's heart stop.  Say I debated calling my mother  but she'd never forgive him.  I thought about calling a friend  I turn to you Reddit.  I'm afraid to leave him at home with my husband at night.  I work 3 nights a week though-- and we can't go without that income.  My husband doesn't think that his is a very big deal but to me it's a HUGE deal.  These are situations that ended in pretty much the best possible way Please help.""",6
"Using a throwaway because I don't want it tied to my normal Reddit Account.   Sorry for the long text... kind of venting.  
My Sister-in-law and her husband went away for the weekend and we reluctantly agreed to watch their 8 year old girl.  I say reluctantly, because she is very bad and there always seems to be a problem with her.  I don't want to sound like I am over the top... but she is extremely manipulative, a compulsive liar, and will blatantly do something you told her not to do.  She will also do something bad/wrong and stare you down, just waiting for you to say something to her. Last week she pulled down her pants in school and mooned the class because she felt like it, and it was funny. At first I just chalked this up to attention seeking, but I think she is on the verge of being a sociopath.  My wife tells me I over-exaggerate, but after yesterday, I think she might begin to agree with me.  The parents always make up excuses and my sister-in-law always makes the comment, I just don't know what to do with her.""  They both make jokes and laugh off the behavior usually with a comment like This incident happened yesterday afternoon and I am still very upset and angry about it.  The cousin slept over our house Saturday night into Sunday.  My son slept in his room My wife got them set up with lunch and after that they wanted to play downstairs and play with the building blocks.  My wife said it was OK for a couple minutes but then they were going to clean up and get the cousin ready to head home.  In that time my wife started to get the laundry together.  Our washer and dryer are in the basement as well.  When she went down that is when she saw what was happening. As soon as the cousin noticed my wife had come down the steps she jolted back away from my son and started playing with some blocks.  My wife asked what was going on  and that is when she noticed that my son's jeans were unbuttoned and unzipped.  My wife immediately asked what happened and the cousin said that they were just playing blocks. My son said My wife called me in from outside and she was visibly upset.  I asked what was going on and she started to tell me.  We separated the children to get the story of what happened.  I went with my son and my wife went with the cousin. My son was concerned that the cousin was in trouble for something so I had to first get him to believe me that she wasn't getting in trouble.  I asked him what they played when I was outside and he said we were playing with blocks and had a 'tickle fight'.  I said ""Oh a tickle fight? How long were you doing that?""  He told me  right.""  He nodded and I added  ""If anyone touches your private parts you tell Mom and Dad right away.""  I asked him about his pants being unbuttoned and unzipped because he has a difficult time doing it on his own - he usually just pulls them straight down without undoing anything.  He said that the cousin did it.  My wife questioned the cousin and she denied everything up and down.  It was obvious she was lying through her teeth... she was shaking My wife calmed herself down but had to get ready to go back to work.  She texted the parents and said that I would like both of them there when they come to pick up the cousin.  It was about 30 minutes later and both of them came and the 16 year old daughter.  I asked the 16 year old to take the cousin out to the car so I can talk to the Parents.  I calmly explained the situation and they just kind of looked at me with a thousand yard stare.  I then told them that she is no longer allowed to stay at our house for any reason and he is not allowed to stay at her house for any reason - until a time that we felt it was safe enough.  I suggested that they take her to a pediatrician to talk to her about it After they left and tried to make sense of the situation my sister-in-law called my wife on her lunch break.  She told my wife how terrible she felt about it My son has a checkup and flu shot next week and we are going to discuss it with our doctor if for nothing else than for the doctor to explain again that you don't let anyone touch your private parts.  Has anyone had a similar situation that can share some advice on what else we can do or if what we did was enough?  My son is pretty much clueless about what happened
TL;DR: My 3 year old son had his penis and butt fondled by his 8 year old female cousin that has a history of misbehavior.  
********EDIT**: Thank you everyone for your advice and stories. I got a lot of great PMs from people as well! Thanks for sharing your experiences. 
As far as updates go: My wife and I talked to her sister again tonight and expressed our concerns about the possibility that the cousin may have been abused either sexually or physically. We showed her a few resources about it and the red flags that the cousin is showing. My wife and I decided against involving CPS at this moment because the sister agreed and promised to follow through with getting the cousin checked out. We did say that if she drags her feet we will report it for the best interest of the cousin. 
I've calmed down and collected my thoughts and I while I am still angry about the situation I realize there are probably larger things at play here. I always just chalked the behavior issues to poor parenting
Again thank you everyone for your help. """,6
"Utterly and completely devastated. I guess that's normal for mothers in this situation - I mean, everyone wishes their children were perfect. I don't know. I've been at the forefront of having him tested and diagnosed, ever since he was a baby I've always known there was something different about him. He never cried, which may seem like a blessing to other mothers - but he never cried. Even when he was hungry. He lost so much weight when I brought him home - because I didn't know when to feed him, he wouldn't tell me. He wouldn't make a peep to save his own life. I had to set my alarm clocks to go off every three hours, so that he wouldn't starve. I knew that was wrong. I knew that babies were supposed to cry. I was always afraid to compare him to other kids his age, because I knew what I'd see. I knew that he'd be so different - and that I'd have to figure out why, and what if... what if it's my fault some how. I spent the last year and a half trying to convince the people around me, including my sons doctors, that he needed to be tested. Everyone gave me the wait and see"" routine. can't they tell that it's eating me up inside? Finally I was a very advanced child - intellectually. By my sons age †I could write my name and speak full sentences. I knew the alphabet. I could recite poems. I didn't have any social skills because I preferred story books over people - but I was content with my solitude anyways. My brain got my through life †color and the size of the wheels. Every wonderful childhood memory I have †that I had hoped to share with my child - has been dashed. He and I will never pretend to be pirates searching for buried gold in the back yard. He will never much care for bedtime stories such as Harry Potter or The Hobbit. We won't play dress-up. He's a year behind developmentally; he may never even reach average intelligence (by it's general definition). Of course I am sad. Of course I don't WANT this for my child. Who would? No one would choose this. Everything that brings me joy in life - he can't relate to. My son will never relate to me. he will never find joy in the things I try and share with him. Still †fighting against a child with OCD-like tendencies who must have the house a certain way†cars lines up in corners and toys in piles that can't be moved or cleaned because than a tantrum is surely coming. Never going out into the world because he hates play dates, he hates family gatherings he hates fairs and festivals and fun family events - not just hateno - but he shuts off. The smallest bit of sensory overload and he stops blinking stops talking stops moving - he dead weights himself. Like he's gone comatose. So no weddings now. No funerals. No family BBQ's. No Easter and the Barn. No festival of lights. Nothing public. Nothing loud. No fireworks. I keep having to tell my friends and families ""Sorrywe can't come"" and them not understanding. ""Why not?"" they ask ""Danny won't like it?"" we plead ""So - he's a toddler. Make him comehe'll like it once he's here"". Because they don't understand they can't understand. It's not easy.†None of this is easy. Pretending like everything is okay and being the super-mom, strong and powerful - advocating for my son.... when all I really want to do is sit down and cryI don't even know if he cares for me, locked away up there in his head like he is. It's hard knowing that all the things I imagined us bonding over are impossible. It's hard watching him get so frustrated and angry because he want's to talk to me - he wants to communicate his needs and feelings - but he literally can not; he gets mad and he pinches me and I have to send him for a time-out when it's not really his fault. He's just reacting to the situation his disability has put him in. It's hard. It's all so hard. †Still, I have to be strong for him because if I don't - no one else will be. If I am not strong. †I am barely allowed to sleep anymore - but god am I tired. And I know, I know I just ranted and raved for paragraphs upon paragraphs and that I didn't pose a question that anyone out there in mommit could truly answer for me - but I needed to do it. I needed to finally tell someone that I am not okay. I needed to be weak †for a moment because as soon as I am done typing this I have to get right back on the phone and start fighting again... and I'll be fighting from now until the conceivable future - as a mother what else is there to do? Edit: Thank You to everyone †for the kind words. It is much appreciated. I turned to the internet for support from other mothers - and I found it. Now that I've been able to voice these thoughts here †I can come back to you with an update on how we are both doing - with good news. Thank you †again - for the support †it's more than I could have thought to ask for.†**Edit Two**: wow wow wow wow. Thank you everyone! I've gotten more tips and hints than I ever thought possible; and I feel great now. I feel ready. I finally actually have an action plan of what I am going to do †we are saving up for an ipad and looking into all the different apps available for him. We are going to start concentrating on the things he does like; science, machinery, cars, †trains, †animals - and stop trying to push the things he dislikes. Encourage who he is; and make no attempts to define who he should be - he'll make that definition himself when he's ready. We are going to be giving our house a little overhaul to check for any sensory things that might have been throwing him off - that we hadn't noticed. My spouse and I will be looking for a support group for autistic parents and I will be educating my family and friends that had previously been acting in a way that was detrimental to my son's development. I am really looking forward to finally having a plan - and making some progress. I can't wait to communicate with my son; it'll make these last two and a half years of hard work all worth it.†",6

"We are attempting to make up a meal plan for the month, something we've never done before.  Usually I look around and make whatever.  I'm tired of making the same old:,Spaghetti & meatballs (my favourite meal)
Chicken nuggets & fries

Chicken souvlaki & rice,I have 4 kids, 18 months, 3 years and two 10 year olds.  They have their favourites, they have things they absolutely outright refuse to eat (older two won't eat shrimp, 10 y.o. daughter despises beef, and on and on).

"We are halfway on a long roadtrip with our 15 month old, and he was SO HARD to feed today. †Every place we stopped seemed to be too distracting, and he refused to eat or drink while in the car seat (he was none too pleased about being in the seat in the first place). †We're making frequent stops at various places, but nothing seems to be working. †Any tips/tricks or suggestions on good places to stop from the travelers among us? relevant?

"We are having some rough times financially, so much so that I applied for WIC, because otherwise I'd be skipping meals so the kids can eat and that would affect my milk supply. Well, the other day I was at the grocery store and the woman in line behind me was the nicest person ever, even offering to hold the baby or unload the cart for me... Until she saw the WIC coupon. Then she stopped talking to me and had this nasty look on her face the whole time. It made me feel so low. We didn't try to conceive while so bad off financially, I was even on birth control. We aren't a case of just having kids to stay on welfare, this is the first time we've needed help. It just made me feel really sad to experience that stark change of attitude. I've never felt more judged in my life. I'm just trying to eat, and to feed my little baby. :( Edit: thank you all for your kind words. It's good to know that people like her are possibly the minority. I'll keep my head up and just keep enjoying being able to nurse my little one.†",6
"We are not extravagant. Quite the opposite. Working couple with a baby. I'd love to be a sahm but husbands salary of $150k, after taxes, house payment, bills, can't cover everything. My neighbor next door is a sahm of 3 and across the street, another sahm of 1. How are people buying homes, cars, paying for life in decent neighborhoods on one salary? 
For example: take home pay is about $6k/mo - after bills, student loans, mortgage, food - there's nothing left! Are we just in too much debt? I don't understand. 
Also - are families w sahm saving for college and retirement funds or are people waiting for loved ones to die and get inheritances? We don't have relatives sadly, ours are deceased and no $$ that way.

"We are not parents but this just happened to us. This story is 100% true but proof will be hard.
We arrived home after going out for breakfast to find a silver SUV parked in front of our apartment.
Standing beside the SUV was as a guy holding a baby. The mother (I presume) was cleaning out the back seat. She was covered in baby poop. It seems the entire back seat was covered in baby poop, too.
The father asked us if we could spare a plastic sack to dispose of diapers and other fouled items. Of course we could! We also also invited them inside our apartment to wash themselves and clean up whatever they could.
The mother was very, very thankful. She accepted our offer and used our bathtub and cleaning supplies to wash the car seat and herself.  After a few minutes she was finished cleaning up and seemed much relieved. 
The frazzled mother thanked us repeatedly as she left our apartment. We watched the young family drive away. My wife and I were a bit frazzled by the whole event ourselves. How weird and funny, at least for us! It struck me that the whole scenario would be a pretty brilliant scam for robbers to convince people to let them into your home.
And that was the end of the story.
Or so we though, as upon the bathroom sink we found the young mother's diamond engagement ring, which she must have taken off during the cleaning.
We're certain they will come back for the ring, but during the experience we didn't even ask their names or phone numbers. We didn't think to write down the SUV's license plate number. Perhaps the most surreal part of this is that we truly have no way to get in contact with them. Perhaps Craigslist Missed Connections""? 
To be continued!
**Update 1** Thank you everyone for your advice. We've called the police and they are sending someone over to pick it up. 
**Update 2** Police came by chuckled at the story
**Update 3 (likely final update)** The ring was collected by its rightful owner! Earlier this evening I looked out our kitchen window and saw the silver SUV parked outside. The wife/mother was searching intently in the area where they had parked during the cleanup craziness this morning. My wife and I went outside with the ring and the wife (Dawn) teared up and gave us both a huge hug. They were planning on coming back anyway to thank us for helping them and they gave us a Target gift card for our trouble",6

"We are trying to get my 9 week old to take a bottle of expressed milk. I have been trying for about 10 days now and all she ever does is take 1-2 oz/30-50mL, if we are really lucky, like only twice in ten days. Most of the time she just plays with the nipple in her mouth. She might latch a few times for a few sucks, but nothing significant. I don't think it is the nipple, as I have tried others and this is the only one she doesn't scream at when it gets close. 
It is really important to me to get her on a bottle as I would like to return to work. My son took a bottle with no problem until he was about 5 months and then refused, which was horrible to deal with while he was in daycare 2 days/wk. I really don't want to live through that again. 
I am looking for any tips on how to get her to quite playing with the nipple and just latch on! I left her alone with my husband today for about 4 hours and she just did the same thing for him until she got to agitated from hunger, that I finally gave in and came home to feed her.

"We became friends 4-5 years ago. I tried dating her for a couple of years but she just wasn't interested - wanted to keep the kid protected. Floated away - got into other things on my own. She liked me again a little while later. So we started dating...things continued on. We moved in.
I discovered lots. Mainly that I cannot deal with a house run by a 9 year old and a mother who doesn't want to manage the 9 year old, but will definitely complain about the 9 year old (constantly). I tried to offer support at first (at mom's request because she was very unhappy with how the kid acted) - whenever mom said something two or three times, then I would say something. I tried injecting other types of support - I got the 9 year old going to sewing class because she really enjoys making her own outfits and trying on random things. I tried things like showing the kid how to do things instead of doing them for her. I asked her to start doing some chores (maybe I grew up wrong but I was doing many things at the age of 9 around the house...).
But I am failing and it hurts me...I've become frustrated and started getting sharper with the child (and mom) after the mom and kid would argue. Now, kid complains to the mom that I make her feel bad - so mom told me to stop disciplining the kid. This leads back to a household being run by a 9 year old. If kid doesn't want to eat a certain dinner, we all change dinner plans. If kid doesn't want to do something when we are out or starts whining about not getting enough attention - mom changes everything taking into account the kid only. I no longer enjoy spending time with them on the weekend because it seems there is constant arguing.
**I know it is not my place to tell a person who to raise their child.** However, my life is affected by it so much - and I am not sure how to separate my emotions from it.
There are other issues as well - but these are normal ones that I've always thought adults had to work through in a relationship. I really enjoy the time I spend with this person when we are on our own, however, I don't think mom really wants to change anything and I have issues telling her to change (even though I have) - more so though - I am very down on myself for being a bad person in the house and causing all of these issues because I don't know how to deal with them...
**EDIT: Reading over this it makes it look like mom is a bad mom...she isn't. Just very protective and wants to make sure kid is taken care of. I don't want to paint her as a bad person. She isn't - which is one of the reasons this is hurting me so much right now. It is just that she doesn't believe in something somewhere and I deep down disagree with it...**",6

"We decided to teach our 5 year old healthy eating habits. We fed her healthy from day one, but were not tyrants. She had treats here and there, at parties, on holidays, special occasions. Now, she is obsessed with food and whenever she is at a friends or relative, she gorges on junk food, and she even hides junk food. What did I do wrong? we took the middle road, not too lax, not too strict!
Secondly, we thought we would teach her about money, saving, spending, sharing, giving. We would teach her about earning a penny or a nickel for doing some chore, and putting coins in the charity box.  Now, she is obsessed with saving money. She demands money for everything she does, refuses to share or give to anyone, and is constantly asking why we don't pay her enough. 
We really tried here, took the middle road, followed the advice and guidelines, and it seems like its blowing up in our face!",3
"We desperately need some advice on this. Our son just turned one and for the last four months has been violently puking every time we drive anywhere.
We thought maybe his car seat was too small so we bought a larger one that sits upright. He still faces backwards. We thought maybe he was too hot/cold so we've tried different conditions/outfits/having air on or windows down and it hasn't had an effect. We've also removed the security mirror, blocked the window with a shade, and have given and removed toys we used as a distraction. We've made sure he has time to digest his food beforehand and that hasn't mattered either. He does it even with someone in the backseat talking to him.
Our ped has suggested giving him benadryl for long car rides but the duration/distance doesn't matter. He pukes sometimes within two minutes of being in the car. Our schedule requires a 20 minute car ride at least 8-10 times a week.
I thought maybe it could be anxiety because he hates being strapped down and even as a baby couldn't handle being swaddled.
Anyone have any advice/suggestions? I'd rather not snow him on the benadryl for super short car rides but he is miserable and his episodes are severe, he literally pukes buckets.

"We drove from Colorado Springs, CO to San Angelo, TX over the holidays.  We have a 21 month old daughter who isn't a big fan of sitting down for long periods of time.
20733,
20734,Tuesday night we set off at 8pm, right about our girls' bedtime.  I decided that if I could drive all night (12 hour trip, about), mom could sleep and be ready to handle the kiddo the next day.
20735,
20736,The night driving was tough, but worth it.  I drank redbull and coffee, and had an audio book.  With stops, we got to our destination at about 9am Central so we clocked in at about 12 hours.  Once kiddo woke up we stopped at a McDonald's where the kiddo could have some food and run around a bit before finishing our trip.
20737,
20738,However, that day was rough.  My daughter suddenly decided she didn't like her Go Crib (and pack and play that you blow up, basically) and wouldn't nap so I ended up sleeping with her in bed.  Same issue that night, except worse because she hadn't been eating much all day and it finally caught up.  She refused to lay still in the bed, refused her pack and play and cried till finally we got up and got her some milk.
20739,
20740,After that she finally went to sleep in the pack and play and we didn't have any more problems afterward.  She napped and slept just fine.  It seems the adjustment period was about a day.
20741,
20742,On the way back, we decided to split the drive up.  We left San Angelo about an hour before her nap time and drove to Amarillo, stopping in a hotel.  I had this grand plan of waking up at 3am and driving through the morning, getting back home at about 8am mtn time.
20743,
20744,We left at about 5am and my daughter/wife slept for about 3 hours which got us almost to Raton.  It worked out pretty well.
20745,
20746,Driving as much as possible while they sleep was our best plan of action because she just doesn't want to be in the car seat for long stretches.  An hour and she'd get a bit fussy, and at 2 hours it was time to get out and run around.

"We got together about a year and a half ago and about 6 months into it he met my son and started spending a lot of time with us. My son's dad is not involved in his life and he has become really attached to my boyfriend. 
Over time my boyfriend realized that he bit off more than he could chew and I became complacent. He decided that he wants to take a step back and reevaluate our relationship and his role and everything. 
I'm just wondering how to approach this with my son, he constantly asks about where he is and he's said things like, [boyfriend] doesn't want me anymore"". We went from spending time together daily and him helping with dinner and putting my son to bed every night to hardly any contact at all. I'm not anywhere near certain that we will work things out and continue a relationship  I feel kind of in the dark about the whole thing. """,6
"We had a natural birth. That was great. But before the birth I feel like I literally did everything around the house. All the laundry, all the dishes, all the picking up and cleaning and all the cooking. Then I started school up in August the day she was born. Since then I've done even more. My SO never takes the reign. She says that breastfeeding sucks up all her energy, but she's unwilling to even go get her own food, with the exception of cereal or oatmeal. I have do to school work, house work, I even donate plasma twice a week to help supplement our food stamps. I have repeatedly asked, no, begged her for help around the house. She's unwilling to put the baby down to even start a load of laundry or fold the baby clothes that have been in my office for a week. We do cloth diapers too, so if I don't clean them then baby gets no diapers. I'm losing it and she's borderline depressed. Wtf can I do?",6
"We have 2 little girls (one is 5 1/2 the other 1 1/2).  The youngest has a bad habit of throwing food all around her mid meal.  She understands some basic words, but not enough to really get the meaning of our frustration.  Any advice?

"We have 3 kids, (6, 3 , & 20 months) and we have a formal anniversary party to go to. We'll be gone from about 4:15 until 11ish.

"We have a 1 week old son who sleeps extremely well in his car seat carrier.  We don't put him in there all the time, just when we haven't slept for awhile and need some sleep.  He can sleep up to 5 hours at a time in that thing which makes me worry that we're cheating"" at being new parents.  However",6
"We have a 20 month-old daughter. I was in the Army when my wife had her, so I missed the birth. My wife also had a tragic experience, being forced into a c-section so that the doc could get home for dinner. She also miscarried the twin very early into the pregnancy. We learned before she was pregnant that she had a septate uterus. A horrible experience. So horrible, even, that she still gets caught up in it, and even wrote a blog post today about it. 
In said blog post - and in conversations with myself and with others - I am made out to be the bad guy. I know she doesn't do it on purpose, but from a third person point-of-view (even to others), I sound like an iron-fist-ruling husband and selfish.
There are reasons I do not want another:
1) I do not want her to have to go through that again, even though I would be there to fight for her, unlike before.
2) I cannot afford another child. This year, we made $25,000. Living in the Seattle area, that is not a good sum of money. I am, however, very good with money. 
3) I do not want to be an even bigger burden on 'the system', being that we receive social benefits, albeit not the only source of our food and what-not, as I put out some of my income on top of the benefits. (Sorry, run-on sentence!)
4) I love having one kid! I love that we will be able to share experiences with her, without having to worry about another one. 
5) We want to open a business within 5-10 years, and I feel having a second child would severely hinder that.
6) Why create a life when there are so many others that need love?
7) I want my wife back at some point before I'm old and lumpy. 
8) She wants time for herself now as it is - imagine if we had another!
9) We want to put her into Montessori school. This would be extremely difficult with another child in-tow, in the way of expenses. 
I am happy with one. I feel as though we can focus on her and ourselves a decent amount. As it is now, we are lucky to get to read or be intimate more than once a week. 
She, too, expresses the same concerns. But then she goes on about having a second. It has hurt me so much that I have even told her that I don't want to talk about it anymore because of the way it makes me feel. 
This is the *only* part of our relationship that has not been in total agreement. Quite literally. 
What am I to do?",6
"We have a 3.5yo and a almost 2yo. Oldest is a boy, youngest is a girl.

"We have a 4 year old boy, he's very fussy over food, his diet pretty much consists of the following - oven chips (fries we make in the oven to de-confuse you USA people), fish fingers, oven cooked chicken, sausages, pasta (no sauce). Lunches are ham or cheese sandwiches (white or wholemeal bread), and yoghurt. The only veg he will eat is boiled carrot sticks, he will eat most fruit though, apples, bananas, oranges, etc. Breakfast is usually toast with honey, toast with marmite, or some sort of cereal with milk.
Every meal is home made, even the oven chips so we know exactly what's in it, we don't do 'ready meals' or 'tv dinners'.
We'd like to try him with other food, introducing sauces to pasta (to hide veg in!), etc. But anything other than what's on the list he'll be so stubborn as to not eat his entire meal, and he'll get so hungry to keep asking for food, but will still refuse anything other than on the list.  We usually try giving him the same as we're eating, but he's very very stubborn!

"We have been going to my bishop for 3 weeks now in efforts to fix our 3 year old relationship, not only for our sake but also for our 11month old son, Avery's sake as well. I'm 18, (please no judging!) Alex, my SO is 19, and we haven't ever been involved with the church. 
Things have been deteriorating in our relationship since Avery has been with us, so finally we went to seek help, my parents suggested a bishop.. of course, typical for living in Utah. (Don't mean that in a bad way..) so we went. I won't say exactly what we talked about, but the 2nd week we went, something the bishop said really changed Alex... I'm not even kidding. (I'll jump back to that in a moment..) so this is towards the end of our week 2 visit with the bishop and this crazy stuff happens. Ok. Alex and I have never really wanted to join the church, but the bishop said since you requested to see an actual councillor you need to attend church..""

"We have never had a successful eating experience. She never did take a bottle, and hates pacifiers. At six months I started with mashed avocado. The second day she choked (not gagged, choked) on a piece and scared me to death so we went to baby purees. She didn't like them and kept spitting it out, eventually she was just clamping her mouth shut and refusing to eat at all. I was frustrated, she was frustrated, so we quit. We're in the middle of a military move to Japan so I figured with the stress, we didn't need to stress more. Of course, though, I still am.
I'm visiting my folks and my dad suggested just handing her food and seeing what happened (soft, easily swallowed) we tried a french fry. She takes it, bit it off, and then gagged and spit it out. Same thing with a cracker. This morning I had bought baby wafers and gave her one- she eagerly took it, put it in her mouth, and broke off a piece. Then she spit it out, and even though 99% of it got spit out, she started gagging and vomited everywhere.
She watches us eat, reaches for food, puts things in her mouth. She has a semi-pincer grasp developed. She nurses (STILL) every 2-3 hours during the day and every 3-4 at night. She seems to be always hungry. She is sitting up and almost crawling. She has two teeth. I'm just at a loss. Its like she doesn't know how to swallow or its triggering her gag reflex every time she tries. I want food to be a positive experience for her!
Has anyone ever had a baby gag on food, or not eat until later, or anything like this? I know there is a bell-shaped curve on everything, but I'm really ready for her to be eating. (I know its not really about me but...) I am worried something is wrong medically, I'm worried she'll NEVER EAT AND I'LL BE BREASTFEEDING HER UNTIL SHE'S 20... you know...

"We have twins that are about to go on 6 months of age. They've been drooley for close to a month and now irritable for a couple weeks. Tonight, we discovered BOTH of our babies are running temperatures (101.5 tested rectally on one and 101.2 axillary on the other). Both being high enough that we got worried and called our pediatrician. Our pediatrician and most advice we looked up said to just watch the baby and make sure they are feeding and consolable (which they are, although they haven't been as hungry today compared to normal days). Surprisingly and contradictingly, they both have been nursing more today than any other day (which we've read that they do less of when teething).
Anyways, we will probably go to the pediatrician tomorrow (she told us if the babies are inconsolable), but definitely we will if they are still running a temp.
From what research we've done, most doctors say fevers (especially ones above 101 - which both of our babies are) are not related to teething. If our babies are not sick, then I think this is a pretty good determinant that fevers are a symptom of teething.
My question out of curiosity (and also to ease my worrisome mind while my babies sleep until morning), how many of you had your babies running a fever when they were teething? ",6

"Well, after problems with my supply since my son's birth 6 months ago, we are now no longer breastfeeding. Not by my choice. We decided to start weaning from the day feedings last week; he was getting too frustrated with my lack of milk and my supply was dropping anyways. The plan was to continue breastfeeding for the morning and bedtime feedings; he is usually relaxed for those. However, my supply dropped completely, even for the morning and bedtime feedings. This morning was my last feeding. He's fine with it; he knows he gets more from the bottle so he hasn't really been wanting the breast for awhile. It's just breaking my heart. I was planning on breastfeeding for a year; exclusively for 6 months. It was hard enough to add formula (which quickly became his main source of calories) at 1 month, and now we're done completely. It's so frustrating, I feel like I've failed as a Mama, even with EVERYTHING we did (which was quite a lot) to get my supply up. Everyone keeps telling me oh †that doesn't help me because I'm not most moms I'm the mama of MY little boy and he NEEDS me and I feel like I have failed him.

"Well, my son just reached 16 months old and over the last couple of weeks I've noticed how much more he's been sleeping. He's always been a good sleeper, sleeping straight through the night since he was three months old. He used to go down around 7:30pm, wake up at 7:30pm and take a couple 2 hour naps during the day. Lately though, as soon as we pick him up from daycare around 5:30, he's immediately ready to crash. I barely have time to feed him or bathe him because he gets so impatient. He's smart enough to try and lead me to his crib when he gets tired, and as soon as he finishes eating he's ready to go down. Almost everyday for the last few weeks, it's been he goes to bed between 5:30 and 6pm, doesn't wake up until 9:30 or 10am and then still takes a couple 2-3 hour naps during the day. Is this normal? Is it a growth spurt? He's not eating MORE but he's also always been a big eater, so it's hard for me to know for sure. He's not running fevers or anything, but I've also noticed looser stool and more dirty diapers since all of this started, too. Has anyone had this before? Is there something else I should be doing? I don't want to prevent him from sleeping if he's tired, I'm just paranoid that there's something else that could be wrong. ",6
"Well, the title says it all!  There really isn't any background required on this I don't think, but if you ask I'll answer.
He's a little boy, very active and vocal, even when he was just a wee little thing.  With my two children (ages 10 and 9), I've always started them off on whole milk at least a week or two in to them turning 1, and before that first year, I've started them on jar food around 8 to 12 months.
This little guy is a little different.  He did well with jar food, at first around that age, but over time, he started to refuse it.  I thought that he just didn't like the taste, but I'd try to get him to eat it anyways (making funny noises that made him smile, etc.)  He'd just spit it right back out and outright refuse.
This has been going on for a while, I'd try different approaches such as allowing him to feed himself with the 'pick up' food pieces from Gerber, letting him walk around while he eats, but that only lasts for a good ten minutes before he's off in his own world.  Sitting him in my lap and trying to feed him, and pretending to eat the food myself so he'd gain interest.
He's not starving by any means, I did try to wean him off formula by introducing him to whole milk, but with his poor eating habits (or me just being silly) I went back to the Good Start, but at stage two for children his age.  
Any suggestions would be great!  I do have him an appointment set in the afternoon on Monday to speak to his pediatrician, and to see if he needs a nutritionalist to help.  (Though, I'm not sure if he's too young for that or not, I don't know.)  Thanks for reading!",1
"Went to a road trip this summer and one night before checking into a hotel my wife suggested picking up a pregnancy test from a store, since she felt like there might be a reason to do one. I paid for the tests and the dude at the register give me a thumbs up and said - not very audible - Good luck Made me laugh and made my wife laugh even harder when I told her what he had said. Anyhow  we were trying to get pregnant Immediate thoughts after that have been the usual I guess: exiting  terrified So here we are. We're still in the early days so anything is possible and we haven't really told too many people yet  just the parents so my wife can talk to someone who has experience at least. So my question is if you - moms especially - have any hints on how to be most helpful in this situation? Let me give you an idea what I mean. She's having morning sickness  feeling tired She is suddenly very picky on what to eat and when she knows what she wants just that moment  that's pretty much the only option that goes. And this might change during the day several times :) Her mom said it was the same for her. Another thing is the she is without a doubt wanting to be a mom  but is also freaked out a bit and I find her staring out the window occasionally clearly thinking how we're going to make through everything. All pretty normal I guess So how can I help? I'm not looking for a specific solution to what I just told  but what can you share on your pregnancy and time in general before your first borns? As a mom Did you like being more or less alone  did it change during towards the end? I mean did you feel like you needed time alone kind of thing. Any romantic ideas to lighten the mood? Did you want to have sex during the pregnancy or wanted to wait until the baby was born? Ideas what kind of things I could plan for her and for how long? I mean after 6 months did you still feel like going out to a restaurant/movie etc or rather stay home? We also have two cats - well duh  we're redditors - and I already told her I'm doing the kitty litter change duties for the next 9 months
And then suddenly I'm thinking this is exactly the opposite she might want to get her thoughts on doing the familiar things together. So help me out  dear redditors",6

"We're due for our first little one in January! We're very excited. I thought I should ask this question here, as this is a large sub with a broad range of topics. If I am mistaken, please move me and accept my humblest apologies!
I've seen convertible cribs, the ones that turn from a crib to a daybed to a toddler bed, and I thought they seemed like a pretty nifty idea. My mom harshly disagrees, saying they're all shitty. The ones I've seen on Amazon and Walmart are all highly rated, though. 
So what's the deal? Do they suck? Are they great? Will it collapse and eat my baby in the middle of the night? Should I just put the kid in a dresser drawer and be done with it? 
Thanks a bunch!
Edit: Alright, I'm putting one on the registry and my mom can just deal with it. Thanks again!",6
"We're expecting our first baby in mid-April. My husband just started a new and fairly demanding job and he'll only be able to take two weeks of paternity leave. Though our immediate and extended family is very important to us, we want to make the most of our limited time and bond with our new baby. Our family ( my mother-in-law in particular) can be extremely intrusive and overbearing. I want to set clear boundaries with everyone from the outset. 
Our plan is this: we are going to take two days, after we arrive home from the hospital to completely bar the doors from family, friends, neighbors etc to have some bonding time. After that, we'll be setting visiting hours ( from 9am to 1pm and then 6pm-8pm, for example) when folks can come by, hold the new baby, help with the laundry, cook a meal etc. Of course, they'll have to call before they plan to come by.
Is this rude to my family? Selfish of me to want some time alone with my new family unit? What did you do after you had your first baby? Is there anything in re: your extended family dynamic that you wish you did differently?
**TLDR** My family can be intrusive- wondering if it is crappy/rude to establish visiting hours in my own home after the new baby arrives",6
"We're having a tough time bottle feeding our 2.5 week old. †She takes the breast 90% of the time, but in the middle of the night she often gets a bottle. †The bottle milk, however, seems to come out too fast and she ends up chugging it and sometimes throws up the entire meal in the process. †We stop her every ounce or so to burp her (she takes 3-4), but sometimes it doesn't matter and she loses the whole feeding anyway. We were using the slowest flowing Tommee Tippie and we switched to the Dr. Browns bottle, which was recommended to us, but even they seem too fast. †Any recommendations on a really slow flowing nipple or how to get the baby to chug less? **EDIT:** †I'll try the paci after a couple ounces and see how she does. †Many of you mentioned 3-4 oz seemed like a lot, but the pediatrician said this was normal. †Thanks for the great suggestions!",6

"We've been enjoying as much of this summertime weather by going out and about as much as we can but I am starting to get really irritated with all the food containers taking up so much space in my diaper bag. I cloth diaper so I already have a ton of stuff and now I'm bring 4-6 containers with me too. So for lunch she usually has chunks of a fruit, chunks of veggies, almond butter and bread, and cheese. So 4 containers plus the usual two containers for snack. Too many containers! She likes to feed herself but doesn't use utensils yet. I'm looking for meal ideas and recipes where I can get as many food groups as possible in one meal. She likes veggie pasta with pasta stars, tomato sauce with added veggies like zucchini and carrots, and then adding ground pork or ricotta cheese. So things like that but it would be great if she could hold the food and feed herself. Thanks!†",2

"What's some really bad advice you received on parenting? For me, the triplets (two months old at the time) were having reflux/vomiting issues. We talked to our developmental doc about it and he suggested adding a teaspoon of rice cereal to their breastmilk bottles. Sure. Fine. We do this for two days. Not only does this not help with the vomit they stop pooping. Now they had been pooping at just about every feed (every three hours, give or take). They actually wanted me to keep feeding them that shit for three more days before stopping. Fuck that, I thought. I stopped the rice and they're still having issues a couple weeks later with BMs.
We've periodically been giving them Karo syrup, which helps. But it also means they go almost an entire day poop-free and then have a fucking blowout.
On top of that, I just read in my premie book that feeding any kind of solid food is epically bad for any baby younger than 4 months. WTF?**EDIT**: For the record, I do call my doctor. I was just there yesterday. Just got off the phone with them today.-Apparently this was unclear, but the kids were pooping every three hours *before* the rice cereal and then stopped completely after we gave it to them for several days. They are still extremely uncomfortable, straining and crying when passing BMs/gas. 
The doctor recommended the Karo syrup, specifically, by name. I don't just get my advice from the internet, though it can be handy.**EDIT** Wow. I'm going to r/funny for awhile.

"When breast-feeding your little one is unexpectedly terminated, it brings up a lot of bittersweet emotion.
I fed my daughter, Vera, for seven sweet months. But after returning from ABC Kids Expo in Las Vegas, my sickness returned, forcing me to take medicine, and inevitably contaminating my breast milk.
The last time I fed Vera was around noon, sadly going to work shortly after as she napped. I returned around 2:00 p.m. to find out from Grandma that Vera wouldn‚Äôt drink from the milk bottle, even though it was filled with my breast milk.
As Vera slept, I worried about this predicament. She woke up relatively happy and not in need of any milk. She ate some apple sauce, pooped a little, and stayed pretty content as I took her brothers to piano class at 5:00 p.m. In this brief time slot, Grandma stayed home to try bottle feeding Vera.
But when I returned at 6:30, I found a crying Vera. She had only drank 1oz before refusing to drink beyond that. She was already extremely grumpy and exhausted from crying. Even as I carried her and tried to bottle feed her, she still wouldn‚Äôt take the bottle and kept crying. I was dismayed -- would my little one survive without my breast milk?
I warmed up the remaining milk for my second attempt at bottle feeding Vera. I was relieved to find that not only did she drink the remaining breast milk, but she also drank 2 additional oz of the formula. What an improvement!
Dad and Vera played until 8:40 p.m. After a soothing bath, dad took over bottle-feeding. I had to stand to the side, filling overwhelmed by all of the emotions of transitioning Vera into formula. These months of nursing her had come to a sad close, and thinking of how she would never rely on her mommy nursing her again brought tears to my eyes.
Rocking Vera to sleep that night felt different -- but I was confident that no matter what kind of milk she drank, she would always be safe and happy as long as she was by mom‚Äôs side.",6

"When I first got back from my maternity leave I was only working nights, which was great cause my SO and I share a car and it meant no babysitter.

I work in a restaurant and my SO goes grounds-keeping so it's not like either of us can take him to work. Plus the whole one car things makes it hard. We can't afford daycare or a babysitter, we barely get by as it is. My parents work full time, and I know of they didn't they wouldn't mind watching him at all. And my SOs parents are both going back to school (cause 5 degrees isn't enough for his mother), and we don't much trust them with our child anyway. I'm at a real loss here with what to do.

"When my daughter was 1-1.5 years old, she started reaching out to us for hugs. At first it was sweet and I ate it up. Then she started wanting them more and more. Had to take a bite of food she didn't want? Hug. Getting her diaper changed? Hug. Sat her in the high chair? Hug. Changed the channel on the TV? Hug. In a new place or around a new person? Hug. Some of these instances are to be expected. I have no problem giving her a hug to reassure her when she's scared or uncomfortable. Or just because. But this morning for example, she requested four hugs (through tears) while having her diaper changed. Two more while getting dressed because I didn't get a book for her to look at during this two minute process. Another two while brushing her hair. And another one because she sneezed. I'm sitting across from her at the table while she eats breakfast right now and she just looked over at me and held her arms out. I didn't get up and give her one, which was okay this time, but produces tears 90% of the time. When she cries she's gotten in the habit of grabbing our hands (mine or DH) to wipe the tears away. I have been fully aware that this has gotten out of hand for a while now, but I don't know the best way to stop it. Should I just stop and let her cry without comfort? Should I give her fewer and fewer hugs or for only certain instances? I don't have a problem letting her cry, but if I do and then don't come over and wipe her tears, she's guaranteed to have a full on breakdown that lasts for at least 30 minutes with poutiness another 30 after that. I feel like if I go that route, it needs to be all or nothing so she fully understands. Note: She's been a bit delayed on speech, but is close to caught up now. We did speech therapy for six months last year. She now has a huge vocabulary and can speak in two or three word phrases that she's heard before (not spontaneous). I'm 50/50 about whether she would understand if I explained why I was stopping with all the hugs.  Second note: We have an 11 week old baby right now (her only sibling), and while we haven't seen an increase in her neediness, we are less able to fulfill her attention seeking behaviors. I add this on at the end because I haven't seen a big change in her behavior with the arrival of the baby, but it may alter how I approach this.",6

"Where to begin... Background: I'm a FTM to a beautiful, wonderful 6 month old girl. I had a bit of a rough pregnancy, but a unicorn labor/birth and the first few weeks were pretty blissful. My husband is wonderful and super supportive. He just started a new job, so things are fairly hectic in our lives at the moment. I work a few hours a week in an office and am trying to start up a freelance business on the side. I've struggled with depression for somewhere near 20 years. I was on a medication regimen that was working, but then I got pregnant and needed to change meds to ones that were safer during pregnancy. I am still on those, though we have been tweaking the dosage levels some. Right after DD was born, I was feeling a flood of emotion. Some bad, but lots of good. It was just different for me to really be FEELING. I've discovered (and this is still true) that my depression medication makes me feel kind of numb and detached. But with the hormone changes for the few days following the birth, I was actually experiencing emotion, and it was wonderful. I was excited about things, overflowing with both joy and terror about how life was going to change for us with a new baby. After a couple days, this wore off. And now, 6 months later, I'm still feeling very numb and detached. My daughter has been healthy, for the most part. She has had some pretty bad colic and/or reflux for the last couple months and that has been pretty hard. She is unhappy a lot of the time, but has spurts where she is very happy and playful. She is hitting all of her milestones and is generally doing very well. I love my daughter. But I'm not in love with her. I'm feeling very numb. When she does something new or cute or exciting, I want to feel a rush of happiness. Instead, I just feel nothing. When she cries endlessly and I can't figure out what is wrong, I get flustered and impatient and just want to walk away. When she is happy and wanting to play, I don't love playing with her. It feels like a chore. I am always tiptoeing around her, trying not to upset her. I have a feeling of dread when she wakes from a nap. She goes to my parent's house one day a week so I can go in to work and they gush over her and say how in love they are and how perfect she is. I believe them, but I don't feel the same way. They have a great time with her and say she was an angel. So what am I doing wrong that she's not happy when she's at home with me the rest of the week? We have also been having trouble breastfeeding lately. Everything was going great for awhile, but my supply seems to have dropped some recently and she gets mad fairly often when I try to give her the boob. We haven't really started much solids yet because we're still dealing with her reflux/colic and want to get her feeling better. We don't have a routine and I feel like we should (or at least everything I read is telling me we should). I just sort of follow her cues. But I can't read her very well, even after 6 months. I thought I would be able to tell when she was hungry or tired or overstimulated or bored. But instead, she just cries and I try different things until something works. †Anyway, I'm just feeling lost, and like I'm failing at being a mom. Not sure if this is PPD or if it's something else. I just want to love this little girl like crazy and be having an amazing time, but I'm not. And I feel awful about it because all I've ever wanted was to be a mom. I do see a psychologist occasionally, but I can't seem to be able to articulate any of this to her when we talk. Any thoughts are welcome. I just needed to get this off my chest.

"Why does it feel like such a major PITA to plan lunch and dinner each day for myself/husband and the baby (so 4 meals a day)? What do other families do because I feel like it really shouldn't be that hard.
I get the whole Baby Led Weaning goal but it doesn't really work for our family. My kid is in that frustrating transitional moment when he only wants to feed himself (will smack the spoon away) but doesn't have enough teeth to really eat most things and the table foods that would be appropriate to share...well, my husband wouldn't eat them. So I'm stuck making 2 meals each meal, for baby and for us.  

Basically meal planning is taking over my freaking life. I go grocery shopping every morning for the meals for that day. I then make 2 lunches around noon and 2 dinners around 5. I make freezable baby food in batches each weekend. Uhh is this normal? I am not susy homemaker - I'm supposed to be a freaking grad student and mom to a baby so this is really not a great situation.

"X-posted to /r/Breastfeeding and /r/beyondthebump, because I need HELP!
TL;DR at the top- 10 week old refusing the bottle, T-minus two weeks until I go back to work for 8 hours per day, husband might actually shake a screamy baby if he has to cope for 8 hours of cray cray.

So here's the problem: In two weeks time, I am going back to work, and I am fairly confident that my kid is going to starve and make all of her caretakers miserable. My daughter is 10 weeks old, and we have been trying to introduce a bottle since week 5.  She either passively lolls it around in her mouth with her tongue, or she freaks out and screams at it. Either way, she hasn't been eating effectively and I am running out of options.
We have tried using tommee tippee bottles with size 1, 2 and vari-flow nipples, we have tried comotomos, and Dr. Browns.
We have tried my husband feeding her while I am out of the house, we have tried faking her out between the boob and the bottle. 
We have tried feeding her before she is hungry, and letting her refuse through an entire feeding so that she famished for the next.
Eventually it all ends in screaming.
She will lap at milk in a cup, but its a really ineffective way of getting milk into her, and I don't think any of the daycares we are waitlisted for will go for that nonsense (Though, watching your two month old lap at milk like a little kitten is the cutest nonsense I have ever seen)
 have about two months before she starts actual daycare, but she will be watched by my husband, some friends, and a babysitter for the next month. In the short term, my husband doesn't feel comfortable watching her if he can't feed her.  He hasn't built up the patience for her screaming, and he can't fix it.  I am also dreading the possibility of her reverse cycling and making the next 9 months of my life miserable, and any daycare is going to require that I provide 5 servings of milk every day, even if she won't drink it. This means that I am going to have to pump 5 completely wasted servings every day. 
Staying home isn't an option for me, I am the primary breadwinner, and we get health insurance through my job.
I'm completely regretting exclusive breastfeeding.  We worked so hard to learn, only to be back at square one.

"Yesterday my son turned 4 and I'm afraid something went wrong somewhere.  It's 2 problems that have tied into 1 giant problem.
In August of 2010 we realized he was slowly starting to eat only chicken nuggets. We kept trying to feed him other foods but with mom and dads busy work schedule it was easier to tell babysitter to give him chicken nuggets. He stopped eating any other meals we were giving him. In December for his 2 year check up the doctor told us it was just a phase whether it lasts 1 month to 2 years he will get over it as long as we keep trying.  We did keep trying and now in December 2012 he is up to eating a few things. His diet includes: chicken nuggets, waffles, sausage, toaster strudels, pizza (he eats any kind), french fries, any juice we give him including the drinkable yogurts, chips and of course candy. I don't know if this is good but he refuses to eat any desserts such as brownies, cakes, cupcakes etc, but he does still like chocolate candies, mostly m&m's which I use as a treat for him being good and using his manners.
Because of this awful diet, he has developed a weird digestive problem. It started with mere constipation, but after seeing a doctor he again told us it was just him trying not to go to the bathroom. That was this summer (2012) and that's when we were trying to potty train. Since we thought he was having trouble going to the bathroom we didn't want to force him to go on the potty when he was trying to push something out every 10 minutes.  We did try giving miralax and milk of magnesia and even suppositories which we were advised to do.
Now we are actively trying again to potty train but he waits until after he has already gone to tell us he has to go. Or he doesn't even act like he has to go and just sits in his messes. 
I guess I'm just asking if anybody else has had similar problems with diets and how to steer clear of the problems.  And any advice on very stubborn kids and potty training. My son says he loves diapers and that's all he ever wants to use. We have even tried using a bicycle as the winning prize of him being fully potty trained!",2
